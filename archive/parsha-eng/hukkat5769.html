one does not see the reality of the thing one is tasting, it is as nothing to
him. Another possibility: They did not taste the delicious flavor [that could
be tasted in the manna] until they toiled with it, grinding it between
mill-stones or crushing it in a crusher. That is implied by the verse in

are disgusted with this rotten bread.&quot;</span> <span class=coversetext>The
Lord sent against the people the venomous snakes, and they bit the people, and
many people of Israel died.</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Having yet to understand the forcefulness of
God's response to the Israelite complaints (<span class=coversetext><i>and many
people of Israel died</i>), an additional question arises, this time one
concerning the means by which the Israelites are healed and repaired. There
seems to be a precise application of the magical notion that certain objects are
endowed with supernatural powers. Isn't Scripture ascribing mysterious curative
powers to the copper snake displayed on a pole, deeming it to be so effective
that a poison snake bite can be healed by just by having the victim glance at
it? <i>And whenever a snake bit a man, he would gaze upon the copper snake and
live</i> </span><span class=coversetext><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bamidbar

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span class=coversetext>Many exegetes have
tried to explain the secret of the snakes' curative powers. The Sages chose a
famous midrash </span><span class=coversetext><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Rosh
HaShana 3:6)</span> to turn our attention away from the healing object - the <i>copper
snake</i> - and to focus our attention instead on the intentions of those
looking at it. According to the midrash, those who believed in the snake's
powers were not cured. Only those who understood that the object's curative
powers were derived from &quot;their Father in Heaven&quot; would be healed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-left:42.0pt;text-align:justify;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span class=coversetext>Could it be that
Moses' hands make war or break war? Rather [the verse's intention is] to tell
you that when Israel gazed upwards and subjugated their hearts to their Father
in Heaven they would prevail, and if not they would fall. Similarly, you say, &quot;Make
a seraph figure and mount it on a standard. And if anyone who is bitten looks
at it, he shall recover&quot; </span><span class=coversetext><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Num. 21: 8)</span>. Could it be that the snake kills
or the snake revives? Rather, when Israel gaze upwards and subjugated their
hearts to their Father in Heaven they would be healed, and if not, they would
waste away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span class=coversetext>It seems the Mishnah
is fighting with all its might against a mode of thought which grants an
independent higher power to nature, objects, or human beings. By denying the
redemptive power of Moses' hands and the curative powers of the snake, it
presses for an extreme anti-magical position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span class=coversetext>RaMBaN takes a
further step in the direction taken by the Sages. He claims that the cure is
effected precisely by the same principle which brings death in order to tell us
that snakes both living and formed of copper are not invested with independent
powers; rather such powers derive from the will of the Creator:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-left:42.0pt;text-align:justify;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span class=coversetext>The secret of this
matter seems to me to be that it is characteristic of the Torah that all its
deeds involve miracles within miracles; the damage is removed by that which
damages, the disease is cured by that which causes disease, as they mentioned </span><span

similarly with the salt Elisha [threw] into the water </span><span
class=coversetext><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(II Kings 2:21)</span>. The
general principle is that the Lord commanded that they effect a cure by using
something harmful and naturally deadly, that they should make an image of it
bearing its name. And when a person looks in the direction of the Copper Snake,
which looked like something entirely harmful, he would live, in order to tell
them that it is the Lord Who both kills and revives. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'><span class=coversetext>That is to say: God chose a particular
instrument of cure - the Copper Snake, which is similar in appearance to the
source of the ailment (notice how similar the words <i>nahash</i> - &quot;snake&quot;
- and <i>nehoshet</i> - &quot;copper&quot; - sound to each other) - in order
that the bite-victim should understand that it is God who kills and restores to
life. However, the human inclination to believe in special people, special
objects, graves, stones, and so forth is stronger than God's message. All
across human culture we can see how this tendency affects life in general and
religion in particular. Our own society seems to be shaking off the last
remnants of modern rationalism and many of its members seek solace for their
pains in the special powers of amulets, holy Kabbalists, and holy places (from
the grave of R. Shimon bar Yohai to Oman, the city of R. Nahman). Returning to
the Copper Snake, we find that eventually it also became an object whose divine
powers were sought out by many. In contrast to the spirit of the Mishnah from
tractate Rosh HaShanah, the Israelites worshipped the copper Snake. This only
ended during the reign of Hezekiah, King of Judah (the end of the 8th century
BCE) when he destroyed the Copper Snake while executing his signature policy of
strengthening the status of the Temple and of Jerusalem:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

narrator also takes pains to show us that Elisha's staff lacks any powers of
its own in the story of the birth, death, and miraculous resurrection of the
Shunamite woman's son. When he dies, his mother runs to Mount Carmel to enlist
Elisha's help. She scolds him: <i>Did I ask a son from my lord? Didn't I tell
you not to trick me?</i> </span><span class=coversetext><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(II Kings 4:28)</span>, but Elisha does not hasten to help. He sends
his staff to Gehazi, telling him to use it to revive the child. </span><i>And
he said to Gehazi, &quot;Gird your loins and take my staff in your hand and go...
and you shall place my staff on the lad's face&quot;</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(verse 29)</span>. The Shunamite does not believe that
an object can revive her son; she does not leave Elisha in peace, but rather
forces him to follow her. Later we learn that the <i>great woman</i> of Shunam
was right while Elisha, the man of God, was wrong: <i>And Gehazi went ahead of
them, and he placed the staff on the lad's face, <b>and there was no sound nor
anyone listening</b>; and he returned toward him and told him saying, &quot;The
lad has not awakened&quot;</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(verse 31)</span>.
The expression, <i>there was no sound nor any one listening</i>,<i> </i><span
class=coversetext>will no doubt remind sensitive readers of a different test
which Elisha's spiritual master had performed on Mount Carmel, when Elijah
confronted the prophets of Baal. That story uses a similar expression in
connection with an ineffective ritual act which goes unanswered because it
ascribes divine powers to ceremonies or objects:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Elisha's staff was like the prophets' gashing
themselves with swords and lances. A staff which is supposed to possess powers
because it belongs to the man of God is no less idolatrous than the rites of
the prophets of Baal who cry out <i>Baal answer us!</i> That is why <i>there
was no sound nor anyone listening</i>. Only when Elisha himself arrived at the
attic and faced the fact that despite his wondrous powers and his having been
appointed a <i>man of God</i> he was, at the end of the day, nothing more than
a human being whose amazing powers were not intrinsic to him, but rather
intrinsic to the God who sent him, only then could he perform the
resuscitation. In that intimate moment, when Elisha found himself alone in his
room with the dead child, he prays to God Who can revive the dead. From the
beginning of the story Elisha had not yet mentioned God's name, but now he
mentions it twice; once when suddenly confronted with his own ignorance while
speaking to Gehazi (<i>and the Lord hid it from me and did not tell me</i>) and
the second time when the narrator recounts Elisha's actions in the attic. The
child's resuscitation is not easy. It requires, first and foremost, a prayer to
God. Following the prayer, the narrator describes Elisha's medical efforts. He
does not perform any &quot;hocus pocus&quot; with the help of a magic wand or
staff; he climbs up onto the bed, respirates the child and warms him. It seems
that the biblical narrator tells us the details of Elisha's actions not only in
order to say that he has to make an effort to resuscitate the child and that
things were not progressing as easily as they had up to this point. We also
understand that for a split second the dead child lying in the bed and the man
of God were as one. The words describing Elisha lying over the child merge them
together: <span class=coversetext><i>And he went up and lay on the child, and
placed his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his palms on his
palms</i>. For one moment Elisha might have felt like a helpless child in need
of someone bigger than him; perhaps it was that feeling of smallness that
allowed him to arouse God's mercy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ascribe supernatural powers to certain items that God has created will continue
throughout human history, as will the struggle against that human tendency</span>.</p>

A man should always be as gentle as the reed and never unyielding as the cedar.
Once R. Elazar ben Shimon was coming from Migdal Gedor, from the house of his
teacher, and he was riding leisurely on his ass by the riverside and was
feeling happy and elated because he had studied much Torah. There he happened
to meet an exceedingly ugly man who greeted him, &quot;Peace be upon you,
Sir.&quot; He, however, did not return his salutation but instead said to him,
&quot;Empty-one, how ugly you are. Are all your fellow citizens as ugly as you
are?&quot; The man replied: &quot;I do not know, but go and tell the craftsman
who made me, 'How ugly is the vessel which you have made!'&quot; When R. Elazar
realized that he had done wrong he dismounted from the ass and prostrated
himself before the man and said to him, &quot;I submit myself to you, forgive
me.&quot; The man replied: &quot;I will not forgive you until you go to the
craftsman who made me and say to Him: 'How ugly is the vessel which You have
made.'&quot; He [R. Elazar] walked behind him until he reached his native city.
When his fellow citizens came out to meet him greeting him with the words,
&quot;Peace be upon you O teacher, O Master,&quot; the man asked them,
&quot;Who are you addressing thus?&quot; They replied, &quot;The man who is
walking behind you.&quot; Thereupon he exclaimed: &quot;If this man is a
teacher, may there not be any more like him in Israel!&quot; The people then
asked him: &quot;Why?&quot; He replied: &quot;Such and such a thing has he done
to me.&quot; They said to him: &quot;Nevertheless, forgive him, for he is a man
greatly learned in the Torah.&quot; The man replied: &quot;For your sakes I
will forgive him, but only on the condition that he does not act in the same
manner in the future.&quot; Soon after this R. Elazar ben R. Shimon entered
[the house of learning] and expounded thus, &quot;A man should always be gentle
as the reed and never be unyielding as the cedar. And for this reason the reed
merited that of it should be made a pen for writing Torah scrolls, Tefillin,
and Mezuzot.&quot;</p>
