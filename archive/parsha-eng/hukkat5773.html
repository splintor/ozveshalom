<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We have already explained that
the whole intention with regard to <i>the Sanctuary</i> was to affect those
that came to it with a feeling of awe and of fear; as it says: <i>Ye shall fear
My Sanctuary.</i> Now if one is continually in contact with a venerable object,
the impression received from it in the soul diminishes and the feeling it
provokes becomes slight. The <i>Sages, may their memory be blessed, </i>have
already drawn attention to this notion, saying that it is not desirable that
the <i>Sanctuary</i> should be entered at every moment, and in support quoted
its dictum: <i>Let thy foot be seldom in they neighbors' house, lest he be
sated with thee and hate thee. </i>This being the intention, He, may He be
exalted, forbade the <i>unclean</i> to enter the <i>Sanctuary</i> in spite of
there being many species of <i>uncleanness, </i>so that one could - but for a
few exceptions - scarcely find a clean individual. For even if one were
preserved from touching a <i>carcass</i> of a beast, one might not be preserved
from touching one of the <i>eight creeping animals, </i>which often fall into
dwellings and into food and drink and upon which a man often stumbles in
walking... Thus all of this was a reason for keeping away from the <i>Sanctuary</i>
and for not entering it at every moment. You know already what [the Sages]
literally say: <i>Even a clean man may not enter the Hall for the purpose of
performing divine service before having immersed himself </i>[<i>in </i>water].
In consequence of such actions, <i>fear</i> will continue and an impression
leading to the humility that was aimed at will be produced. To the extent that
a certain kind of <i>uncleanness</i> was more frequent, purification from it
was <span class=GramE>more</span> difficult and was achieved at a later moment.
Being under the same roof as dead bodies, more especially those of relatives
and neighbors, is more frequent than any other kind of <i>uncleanness.</i>
Accordingly one is purified from it only by means of the <i>ashes of a </i>[<i>red</i>]
heifer, though these are very rare, and after seven days.</p>

extraordinary story of the copper serpent. This is a unique story of the
meeting between art of the image and the prohibition against idolatry; it is
one of rare instances in the Bible in which we can relate to the art of image
not in the direct context of the injunction against idolatry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>God instructs
Moshe, following <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
attack by the burning serpents:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>Make for

will see it and live. (<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bemidbar 2<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>:8). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>We note than
in God's instructions to Moshe, the word &quot;serpent&quot; [<span
class=SpellE><i>nachash</i></span>] is not at all mentioned. Yet we assume that
the word &quot;<i>seraph</i>&quot; is synonymous with the serpent. And what
does Moshe actually do? &quot;And Moshe made a &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>nachash</i></span><i>&quot;
- </i>a serpent - of bronze and he placed it on a standard and it was that if a
serpent bit a man and he looked upon the serpent of bronze, he would live&quot;
(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Ibid. ibid, 9).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>As we
mentioned, &quot;<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>nachash</i></span></span><i>&quot;
</i>[viper] and &quot;<i>seraph&quot; </i>[burning snake] are synonymous, Yet
it is interesting to note that the material chosen by Moshe for the crafting - bronze-
is also absent from God's directive. We must ask ourselves whether or not this was
an independent artistic choice on Moshe's part. Rashi writes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>He was not
ordered to make it of bronze, but Moshe said: The Holy One, blessed be He,
calls it <i>nachash, </i>so I will make it of <i>nechoshet </i>[bronze], <span
class=GramE>an<b> alliteration</b></span><b> [</b><span class=SpellE><i>nechash</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>nechoshet</span></i>]<b>.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
class=SpellE>Rashi's</span> explanation is puzzling for two reasons. If God had
used the term <i>seraph</i>, then there is no alliteration. But a more basic
question must be asked - what place is there for wordplay in a decision
regarding the creation of the bronze serpent and the material from which it is
made? In order to understand this, we should try to understand how the bronze serpent
worked. The famous Mishnah in Tractate Rosh Hashanah <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(3, 8) </span>reads:<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>The same
lesson may be taught thus. [It is written], 'Make for yourself a fiery serpent
and set it up on a pole, and it shall come to pass that everyone that is
bitten, when he sees it, shall live'. Now, does the serpent kill? Does the
serpent cure? No, [what it indicates is that] when <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> turned their thoughts heavenward
and subjected their hearts to their father in heaven, they were healed, but
otherwise they pined away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>This <span
class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> is difficult to comprehend. Ostensibly, there is no
connection between the serpent's mode of operation and its serpent essence.
According to this Mishnah, if indeed the heart of the matter is the looking
heavenward it would seem that Moshe could have placed on the pole a bat or a
frog. Ibn Ezra, in <span class=GramE>his</span> commentary, reinforces the
approach which neutralizes the &quot;serpent-<span class=SpellE>ness</span>&quot;
of the serpent; he is careful not to attach any special powers to the snake
image:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>Yet many
erred, saying that this form can receive celestial powers. Forefend and
forefend! - <span class=GramE>the</span> object was fashioned at God's
directive, and it is not for us to seek the reason why the serpent form was
chosen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The <span
class=SpellE>Ramban</span> offers a completely different approach:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>It would have
been proper that those bitten by the fiery serpents never again see a serpent nor
remember nor recall it at all. But the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moshe
to make for themselves the image of the serpent which had killed them. Therefore
Moshe found no other way to fulfill His command to create a serpent other than
by making a bronze serpent, for it has the image of fiery serpent [...] and
when a person looks with proper intent upon the bronze serpent which is strongly
resembles the live scourge, he is informed that it is God who kills and cures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
class=SpellE>Ramban</span> voices an approach according to which Moshe's choice
of bronze is not at all arbitrary. His choice stems from the profound principle
that part of the cure lies in the fact that the substance which harms is the
substance which cures, and thus we express God's being both life-taker and life-giver.
This even intensifies the miracle essence of the act; God rules nature wherein
the same element both harms and restores. </p>

In his commentary &quot;<span class=SpellE>Iggude</span> <span class=SpellE>HaTalmud</span>&quot;,
the researcher Moshe <span class=SpellE>Benovitz</span> suggests that <b>the

divided into two different acts. <span class=SpellE>Benovitz</span> brings

Babylonian Talmud. In other words, he struck the tablet once so as to remove it

hid the Nechushtan which stood on the banner and was hung, it seems, on the
wall of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City>,

class=GramE>The uncommon reality of God himself commanding the creation of a
sculpted figure opens the door to many questions about the nature of this
figure's function and the manner in which it was perceived by the Jewish people,
and the attitude of Chazal, exegetes and researchers towards it.</span> This
attitude oscillates between relating to the serpent's powers as a decree whose specific
essence is not open to inquiry, and highly graphic explanations which relate
the serpent's specific form and specific powers to natural and supernatural
matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>It is
interesting to note that this serpent, created at God's command, could not help
but enter the circle of idolatry. It is almost inevitable that such an object -
from a Biblical perspective - should, sooner or later, become a focus of
worship. Then along came King Hezekiah and - whether by a single hammer blow,
or whether by crushing and smashing the Nechustan to fine powder - left us with
the secret of the serpent to ponder forever.</p>

a camel, it would sacrifice it before me? Therefore He arranged that his

carefully learn the laws of vows and oaths, so that they do not err in their
vows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i>&quot;There was his daughter

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Because he wanted to sacrifice

should offer up before The Holy One, Blessed Be He, human sacrifices? Does it
not say in the Torah &quot;<i>When any of you presents an offering of cattle to
the Lord, he shall choose his offering&nbsp;<b>from the herd&quot; - </b></i><b>from
the herd, not from humans. </b>He replied: My daughter, I vowed, &quot;<i>Whatever

Din, perhaps they will find a way to release you of your <span class=GramE>vow

because of their sin in slaughtering members of the tribe of <span

class=SpellE><i>Halacha</i></span>&nbsp;from them, so that they do not find a
way to release <span class=SpellE>Yiftach</span> of his vow. He went up and
slaughtered her. And the Holy Spirit screams out: Did I want to offer before me
that &quot;<i>which I never commanded, never decreed, and never entered my
