superfluous, and Chazal, in Hullin (91) dealt with this. According to a plain
reading (<i>peshat)</i> the meaning of <b><i>&quot;as he wrestled with him</i></b>&quot;
is that until now, the angel wrestled with Yaakov, and now the angel desired to
withdraw, but Yaakov renewed the fight and wrestled with the angel, and as a
result he was punished, and his hip was sprained, and this is because Yaakov's
attribute is an abundance of love of peace, as we have explained above,
therefore he should have rested when the angel withdrew. But he betrayed his
character, and therefore he was punished <b>in his hip, </b>where walking
originates, and this [is symbolic] of man's customary behavior - and this is a
major rule, that when a person's behavior is marked by a good quality, it is
considered as though he took upon himself this quality with a vow, and
afterwards, should he behave otherwise, he is punished - and it may be further
said that this comes as a lesson for all generations, and the father's act is
an example for the sons... <b>and it comes to instruct us how one should behave
with his adversaries, not to fight them excessively, </b>and when the danger
recedes, it is proper to allow the assailant to go on his way, and this [the
wrenched hip] is to remind us of this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

A state of all its citizens? Few - too few - deal with the question of whether
this state (whatever be its definition) is just or unjust. I should like to
devote this study to examination of our attitude and that of Biblical sources
to <b>power, </b>to the use of power and to power gaps. At the outset of our <i>parasha</i>
is would seem that Yaakov's wealth has psychological effect on both Yaakov and
his brother Esav. Throughout the parasha, Yaakov's (and his family's) strength
is tested: against Esav, against the angel, against Schechem's behavior with

supported himself as an employee (thank God, a successful one). Avraham was a
nomadic shepherd who amassed his wealth in part from reparations (Avimelech,
Pharaoh). Yitchak, in contrast to his passive image, was a successful,
independent farmer. Wealth marks the social rank of the patriarchs as compared
with that of their personal and ideological competitors. For example, the
awarding of compensation to Avraham and Yitchak for the jeopardizing of their
wives is seen as affirmation of their being in the right. As a rule, Avraham is
wealthy - ergo, he is right; Yitzchak is successful - it is a sign that God is
with him. Yaakov's success despite Lavan's deceitful efforts - signifies God's
support, as in the words of Kohellet &quot;<i>And God seeks the pursued&quot; </i>(3:16).
According to this approach, <b>wealth in itself, and relative wealth </b>(a
large economic gap) in particular, is a fact which has political and spiritual
significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as a destructive force. Wealth, like all authority and power, brings
callousness, pride, a sense of omnipotence, and consequently leads to personal,

influence of this analysis on the middle class). We have not found in the Bible
condemnation of wealth <i>per se</i>. We have found censure of the sinning and
apathetic affluent, and there is the call for concern for the indigent. Gaps of
power, resources and opportunities are part of the Biblical world, and
therefore, perhaps, one should not wonder that the religious parties carry no
egalitarian social message, but rather one of <i>tzedakah</i> - charity - which
creates and perpetuates dependence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discussions of an economic package, it is clear that upon reaching agreement,
there will be a lottery for opportunities in the work market; every citizen
will be assigned by chance to a job, to intellectual and economic position, in
keeping with the division of the cake as proposed in the new arrangement. In
other words, every citizen would have equal opportunity to be a university
lecturer, or to be the unemployed father of a twelve year old, illiterate girl
who cleans up the lecture halls at night. The probability of each placement
would be in proportion to the relative size of each level of the population; the
Minister of the Treasury would have more than a 40% chance of being in need of
salary supplements, and the Chairman of the Workers' Committee of a powerful
government company would have more than a 100% chance of earning minimum wage
or less working for a manpower organization than of retaining his present
position. Such a mechanism would insure that persons of power at the time of
decision would really be concerned with minimum conditions of opportunity for
every citizen; they would, in all probability, be less concerned with charity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

faults Dinah for her 'going out'. It would seem that one should remain at home
if he wants security. It's dangerous outside. But in many other places in the
Bible, we find that supposedly safe places are not free of dangers - in Sodom
and in Geva Binyamin the outside dangers menacing visitors are augmented by the
decisions of the men to expose the women who are inside with them (the
concubine or the daughters) to these dangers. In the stories of Avshalom and
Tamar, Yosef and his brothers, Esav and Yaakov, the danger lurks inside the
house. Our commentators were not apathetic to the violence revealed in Avraham's

in order that man learn from it positive qualities and how to avoid bad ones.&quot;
But we are quite blind to this violence. Similar things occur in our society.
Much is said about terror from without, and perhaps even about road accidents,
but the &quot;safe&quot; places are not safe - 25,000 files pertaining to
violence in the family are opened yearly. This is the basis for the estimate of
200,000 families suffering from violence [usually by the male]. Between 10-25%
of schoolchildren are exposed to sexual attack and harassment in school, a
place which, by law, they are required to attend. Here, too, the question is
whether we are dealing with the <b>consequences</b> of the unchanging ratios of
power (e.g., shelters for beaten women) or whether we deal with the ratios of
power themselves (in all Israel there is only one &quot;Bet Noam&quot; where
violent males learn to modify their behavior)? Are we prepared to lessen the
very need for power gaps? The ratios of power and strength between men and
women, between adults and children, between family members, between them and
strangers - these and the exploitation of power within the framework of these
relationships are basic facts in the narratives of the Book of Bereishit. These
stories shape our thought, our culture, and our religion, and they limit the
horizon of our opportunities as we attempt to consider the cost of our shaping
of our world and possible alternatives - both partial and system-wide alike.
The understanding of these formative influences is one of the main
contributions of feminist thinking, and it seems to lie at the heart of
prophecies of <i>geula</i> (e.g., Isaiah 11; Ezekiel 11, 34, 36) in which the
redemption is described in terms of change of relationships between human
beings and in the entire world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The basis for this outlook is concern not only for the weak, but for society as
a whole. Following the prophets and Maimonides, Mahatma Ghandi and Martin
Luther King also taught that the struggle for justice is not only for the sake
of saving the oppressed from oppression, but (also) in order to save the
oppressor from the role of the oppressor. Salvation will come not from <b>tsedakah
- charity, </b>but from <b>tzedek - justice</b>, from the freeing of the master
from his mastery. This is a theological, political, communal, economic and
personal choice. Everything depends upon our conception of God (= power...) for
our conception of God's relationships with our people is shaped, in the Bible,
in terms of power relationships. An alternative is also to be found there - in
more intimate relationships, in more love than fear, and there, too, is there
need for the <i>geulah</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
