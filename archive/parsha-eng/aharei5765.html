<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>We
have become accustomed to relate to the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>midrash</span></span>
about the four sons with profound gravity and seriousness. Some find in it the
kernel of a panacea for all of the problems of Jewish education, a kind of
&quot;road-map&quot; for the Jewish People's continued spiritual existence. I
would like to suggest a less ambitious interpretative strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Note
the location of the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>midrash</span></span>
of the four sons in the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span>. Two passages appear
immediately before it: The incident involving Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Eliezer</span>
and his colleagues who celebrated the Seder in <span class=SpellE>Benei</span> <span
class=SpellE>Brak</span>, and the words of R. <span class=SpellE>Elazar</span> <span
class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Azaryah</span>, who described
himself as being &quot;as one seventy years of age.&quot; Next <span
class=GramE>come</span> the four sons, followed by the <span class=SpellE>halakhic</span>
discussion, &quot;One might start from the New Moon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>These
four passages appear consecutively; what is their common theme? The answer is
clear: None of these passages comes to tell us about the Exodus from Egypt,
none of them adds any information to what we have already learned from the
section &quot;We were slaves.&quot; Their purpose is to tell us something about
the manner in which the commandment to retell the story of the Exodus should be
observed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Before
we get to the main section of <span class=SpellE><i>Maggid</i></span><i> - </i>the
retelling - before the many <span class=SpellE>derashot</span> dealing with the
Exodus itself, the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span> wishes to tell us
something about how we should go about performing the commandment of, <span
class=GramE><i>You</i></span><i> shall tell your son</i>. The core message is
quite <span class=GramE>plain,</span> the main principle has already been set
out in the end of &quot;We were slaves&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>And
even if all of us are wise, all of us understanding, all of us aged, all of us
knowledgeable about the Torah, we are still commanded to retell the Exodus from
Egypt. And the more one speaks of the Exodus from Egypt the better.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Rabbi
<span class=SpellE>Eliezer</span> and his distinguished band of friends come to
demonstrate how one is supposed to carry out the principle of &quot;the more
one speaks the better&quot; in practice: &quot;They spoke of the Exodus from
Egypt all through that night, until their students came and said, 'Our Rabbis,
the time has come for the recitation of the morning <span class=SpellE><i>Shema</i></span>.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Next
<span class=GramE>comes</span> R. <span class=SpellE>Eliezer</span> <span
class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Azariyah</span> to explain why the
Exodus must be mentioned at night. The four sons now make their appearance.
Next, the editor of the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span> emphasizes the
importance of devoting many hours to retelling the story of the Exodus by
entertaining the theoretical possibility that people could begin performing the
commandment from the first of Nissan. <span class=GramE>All of these passages
aim at instilling us with readiness to retell the story of the Exodus in the
best way possible, i.e., for many hours into the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Here
we are confronted with a very important practical difficulty. How are we to
engage our sons and daughters - who are, after all, the &quot;target
audience&quot; of the Seder - in the commandment of <span class=GramE><i>You</i></span><i>
shall tell your son</i> for hours on end? Perhaps our children are not really
interested in a long, drawn-out discussion?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The
four sons illustrate four typical responses of children to our educational
efforts during the Seder. Their responses are typical, but there is no reason
to assume that any one particular child will always behave like the wise son,
or like the wicked son. It all depends upon his age, his mood, his wakefulness,
and his stomach. If he did not take a nap in the afternoon, last year's wise
son can become this year's wicked son. The son who does not know how to ask
questions can turn into the wise son, thanks to the efforts of a talented
teacher. What then is the advice which the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span>
offers us in dealing with our children's various behaviors?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
wise son: What does he say? &quot;<i>What are the statutes and ordinances and
laws which the Lord our God has commanded you?</i>&quot; And you shall tell him
the laws of the Paschal sacrifice [up to the detail]: &quot;No desert is eaten
after the <span class=SpellE><i>afikoman</i></span>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Here
we have important messages for both parent and child. The child wants to behave
appropriately and win praise. The <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span> tells him
what to do: If someone wants to look intelligent, he must ask many detailed
questions. The message for the parent is no less important: If the child begins
asking complicated and perhaps even annoying questions, the parent should not
throw his hands up in despair, crying out, &quot;God Almighty, this kid is
driving me crazy!&quot; Rather, the parent must take advantage of the
opportunity offered by the child's curiosity and teach the child as much as
possible, &quot;And you shall tell him the laws of the Paschal sacrifice [up to
the detail]: 'No desert is eaten after the <span class=SpellE><i>afikoman</i></span>.'&quot;
Such a parent will, no doubt, need to gird himself with patience and listening
skills.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The
dialogue with the wicked son is a different story. We must first understand
exactly who this &quot;wicked son&quot; is who appears in the <span
class=SpellE>Haggadah</span>. Is he a little heretic, a reincarnation of
Spinoza or of <span class=SpellE>Elisha</span> <span class=SpellE>ben</span> <span
class=SpellE>Avuyah</span>? Or perhaps the &quot;wicked son&quot; is a lowly
traitor who collaborates with <span class=SpellE>Hamas</span> and Islamic
Jihad? To my mind, we are dealing with a much less shocking situation. In his
commentary on the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span>, the RITVA, following the
Jerusalem Talmud, formulates the wicked son's question in these words:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>What is this bother that you trouble us
with every year, delaying our feast?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In
other words, the wicked son is asking: &quot;<span class=SpellE>Nu</span>, so
when do we eat already?&quot; The wicked son's impatience teaches us that it is
most inappropriate for one to announce one's hunger to the other participants
in the Seder while they are engaged in discussing the Exodus. Thus is solved
the famous question regarding the differences between the wise and wicked sons.
They both ask exactly the same question (&quot;What are you doing?&quot;), only
that the wicked son speaks curtly in order to have the meal served as quickly
as possible. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>What,
then, is the proper response to the wicked son? If a child complains that he is
hungry, are we to &quot;set his teeth on edge&quot;? I believe that the <span
class=SpellE>Haggadah</span> offers its own harsh response in order to spare us
the need for such unpleasantness. We do not have to answer the evening's
&quot;wicked son&quot; - the <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span> has done that
for us when it announced before the world that a person who complains that he
is hungry at the Seder is behaving like a &quot;wicked son&quot; who has
&quot;removed himself from the community.&quot; The <span class=SpellE>Haggadah</span>
reminds us all that those who wish to be redeemed must demonstrate patience.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It
should be no problem to guess the meaning of the passage regarding the
&quot;simple son.&quot; He asks a simple question and receives a simple answer.
If a child asks, &quot;What's that?&quot; and we bury him under a long lecture
describing &quot;the laws of the Paschal sacrifice [up to the detail]: 'No
desert is eaten after the <span class=SpellE><i>afikoman</i></span>'&quot; our
efforts shall be wasted. In such a case, it is better to answer plainly: <i>With
a mighty arm, the Lord took me out of Egypt, from the house of bondage</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Finally,
we get to the one &quot;who does not know how to ask.&quot; Here we are not
dealing with a child who refuses to participate in the <span class=GramE>Seder,</span>
rather he is not sure about <i>how</i> to participate. There are many different
reasons why a child may not know how to ask: perhaps he is shy, or he thinks he
already understands everything and is left with nothing to ask, or he might
feel that the Seder is aimed towards his younger siblings, and that it would be
inappropriate to interject with questions that are of interest only to the
older children. In any case, it is incumbent upon the parent to &quot;open up
for him,&quot; a way must be found for him to participate in the Seder as an
educational experience. This certainly demands that the parent be attentive to
how the &quot;passive&quot; child understands his own role in the evening's
activities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Each
and every child can pass through a series of transformations in the course of
the Seder, moving from archetype to archetype of the four sons. A particular
child may begin as the one &quot;who does not know how to ask.&quot; When the
parent tries to open up the discussion for him and becomes a bit long-winded,
the child's stomach might get the best of him, making him a &quot;wicked
son.&quot; After a few minutes, he might compose himself and ask
&quot;simple&quot; questions. Finally, as <span class=SpellE><i>maggid</i></span>
is reaching its end and the meal is almost served, the child may allow himself
to let loose with an onslaught of &quot;wise&quot; and complicated questions,
which leave even the most experienced and learned of grandparents struggling
for answers! There is no escaping it: Our duty is to remain flexible enough to
deal with <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>any </b>educational challenges
with which our children face us at the Seder table.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>...it seems to me that
the reason for the fact that all the sin-offerings, both of private individuals
and of the congregation are he-goats [<span class=SpellE><i>se'irim</i></span>]
- I refer to the he-goats [offered on the occasion of the festivals] of
pilgrimage, on the New-Moons, on the Day of Atonement, and [for the sin] of
idolatry - is that the reason, in my opinion, was that their greatest act of
disobedience consisted at that time in sacrificing to the <span class=SpellE><i>se'irim</i></span>
[the same word can mean both &quot;goats&quot; and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>&quot;devils&quot;</b>]; as the text states: <i>And they shall no more
offer their sacrifices to the <span class=SpellE>se'irim</span> after whom they
have gone a whoring</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Vayikra</span>
17:7)</span>. However, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, consider that
the reason for which the congregation is constantly atoned for by means of <span
class=SpellE><i>se'irim</i></span> is that the whole congregation of Israel
committed their first act of disobedience with the help of a kid [<span
class=SpellE><i>se'ir</i></span>] of goats. They refer to the sale of Joseph
the righteous, in whose story it is said: <i>And they killed a kid of goats,
and so on </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>
37:31)</span>. Do not regard this reason as feeble. For the end of all these
actions is to establish firmly in the soul of every disobedient individual the
constant need for remembering and making mention of his sin - as it said: <i>And
my sin is ever before me</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Tehillim</span> 51:5)</span> - and that he, his descendents, and
the descendants of his descendants, must seek forgiveness for the sin by an act
of obedience belonging to the same species as the act of disobedience...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>Inasmuch as the he-goat
that was sent forth into the wilderness served wholly to atone for great sins,
so that there was no sin-offering of the congregation that served as atonement
in as great a measure as that goat, which was as it were the bearer of all the
sins, it was not to receive at all such treatment as being slaughtered or burnt
or sacrificed, but had to be removed to as great a distance as possible and sent
forth to <i>a land that is cut off</i>, I mean one that was separated from
habitation. No one has any doubt that sins are not bodies that may be
transported from the back of one individual to that of another. But all these
actions are parables serving to bring forth a form in the soul so that a
passion toward repentance should result: We have freed ourselves from all our
previous actions, cast them behind our backs, and removed them to an extreme
distance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>My friend, <span
class=SpellE>Yossi</span> <span class=SpellE>Penini</span>, published a
pleasant, interesting, and sociable article in issue number 387 of Shabbat
Shalom. That is all well and good, but it is built upon a common mistake, one
made even by serious and important rabbis. There does exist a biblical holiday
marking the entry to the Land, and its function is to complete the epic story
of Israel's beginnings, namely - the festival of Shavuot. In the days
approaching Shavuot, upon bringing the first fruits to the Temple, every
householder had to recite the special declaration which appears in the
beginning of <span class=SpellE>parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Ki</span> <span
class=SpellE>Tavo</span>. Each Israelite would return to the nation's
foundations: The Patriarchs (the preamble to <i>national</i> history), the Exodus
from Egypt (celebrated on <span class=SpellE>Pessah</span>), and the entry into
the Land (celebrated on Shavuot). The recitation for the first fruits was
deemed so important by the early rabbis that after the Second Temple's
destruction, they decided to enter the entire text into the <span class=SpellE>Pessah</span>
Seder, &quot;until the end of the entire passage.&quot; After centuries of
exile, new generations of rabbis who wished to justify Diaspora life
&quot;revamped&quot; the holidays: They censored the text of the recitation,
cutting out all mention of the entry into the Land. Furthermore, they
completely changed the significance of Shavuot. The goal of the Exodus became
the reception of the Torah at Mount Sinai, rather than the entry into the Land
and the return to agricultural work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>Secular Zionism has
started off on the road towards reinstating Shavuot with its original
significance, but religious Zionism seems stuck in the ways of Diaspora
religious thinking, so distant from the reality of a people living in its land.</p>
