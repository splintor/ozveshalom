things of which you spoke in the name of the Lord are indeed to be found, and
as we heard so we saw, and this is the meaning of &quot;we came to the land to
which you sent us&quot;. For were something to have been different, it would
seem that this was not the land to which you sent us since some of those things
described were lacking. And in addition to your words, it is also a land
flowing with milk and honey. But we did discover one inaccuracy in your words,
for you had given as a sure and proven sign that the mighty inhabitants dwell
in the unfortified communities, and regarding this they said &quot;But the
people who dwell in the land are mighty and the towns are fortified and very
large&quot;. For the term <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>effes</span>'</span> means 'only' and 'but'. Read carefully and
note that they said towns are fortified and very large&quot;. In <span
class=SpellE>Devarim</span> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(1:28)</span> however,
Moshe said that the scouts had said &quot;large towns and fortified to the
heavens&quot;, but we do not find that they had said &quot;to the heavens&quot;,
but Moshe detected in their words disbelief in the Holy One, for they said, &quot;he
is stronger than we&quot;, implying that even the owner of the house cannot
eject his vessels <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Sotah</span>
35a)</span>. They are saying that this strength comes from the stars of heaven
and their constellations, and this is the meaning of &quot;fortified to the
heavens&quot;, that their constellations in heaven are stronger than He, as it
were. And in the beginning they did not express such heresy explicitly, they
just said 'fortified and very large', but when Caleb rose and contradicted
them, they spoke explicit heresy &quot;for it is mightier than Him&quot;. Their
final words reveal that their opening words also contained heresy, as if they
had said &quot;fortified in heaven.&quot;</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> - </span>the spies - is one of those
chapters which <span class=GramE>has</span> become standard fare of adherents
to the Greater Land of Israel movement. The plain meaning of the text does not place
obstacles in the path of the anonymous commentator who wants to derive messages
which support his world view: the ten <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>are described as demoralizers,
cowards and conspirators who implant faintheartedness in the populace. They
defamed the land, thereby causing our fathers to wander in the desert for forty
miserable and superfluous years. Opposing them were Caleb <span class=SpellE>ben</span>
<span class=SpellE>Yefuneh</span> and <span class=SpellE>Yehoshua</span> bin
Nun who swam against the current and inspired the people with faith, men carved
from the material of fearless leaders, the finest of our sons. What is the
political message to be learned from this <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>? At
first glance, the answer is simple: We must believe that the Holy One, Blessed
Be He, will assist us in conquering the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Israel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
which was promised us, even though the mission seems impossible. The Jewish
people do not fear the long journey...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It is very
difficult to neutralize political and ideological tendencies when plain-reading
the passages of the weekly <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>; it is very
tempting to present the sin of the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>meraglim</span></span> in an actual/nationalistic light. But, as
Professor <span class=SpellE>Uriel</span> Simon writes: &quot;A
contemporary-political reading of Scripture which expresses itself in the enlistment
of texts in order 'to prove' the justice of a particular political path, is
improper, for it lacks the respect due the Bible and because it is
manipulative, impatient, and rushes to gather converts&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bakesh</span> Shalom <span
class=SpellE>V'radfeihu</span>, p. 16)</span>. But despite this, the Bible can be
relevant. How? Prof. Simon suggests: &quot;We must strive to understand the
Biblical values as they are, and only afterwards apply them to contemporary <span
class=GramE>issues,</span> and this with constant awareness of similarities and
differences between then and now&quot;. If we follow Simon's approach, we will
find the central value arising from the plain-reading of the text is, indeed,
that of faith and trust which God demanded of the <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span> as he tested them,
but this is not the sole value. From the <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim's</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>biased presentation that first
described the good of the land and later negated it with word <span
class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>effes</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>'</span> - 'But...&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(13:28)</span>, and from the people's hysterical
reaction which followed, we can learn much about the power of manipulation. We
can conclude from this story the Biblical value of striving for objectivity,
relevant in our day, for example, to media coverage. Finally, one can also
learn about the importance which the Torah attaches to the minority's (<span
class=SpellE>Yehoshua</span> and Caleb) standing up to express its moral voice
against the spurious presentation of the majority. This standing fast is also
important when the minority's voice is unpopular, when the majority seems
overriding and threatening violence (&quot;And the community meant to pelt them
with stones&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(14:10)</span>). All these
values are relevant to various groups, and should not be used to justify a
particular political policy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Although plain-reading
of the <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> demands unbiased reading, the tool of <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>midrash</span></span></span>
provides the opportunity to express personal and moral leanings, not remaining
on the level of loyalty to the written word. So, for example, Rabbi Meir <span
class=SpellE>Simcha</span> of <span class=SpellE>Dvinsk</span>, author of &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Meshech</span> <span class=SpellE>Chochmah</span>&quot;, utilizes
a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>midrash</span></span></span>
in order to weave the sin of the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>meraglim</span></span> into the Biblical confrontation with idolatry.
In an attempt to explain the words &quot;about [lit<span class=GramE>. '</span>to']
Moshe&quot; in the passage &quot;And Caleb silenced the people about Moshe&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(13:30)</span>, the <span class=SpellE>Meshech</span>
<span class=SpellE>Chochmah</span> writes: &quot; The people were afraid,
because they had heard <span class=SpellE>Eldad</span> and <span class=SpellE>Medad</span>
prophesying 'Moshe will die and <span class=SpellE>Yehosuha</span> will lead
into the land' (according to Sanhedrin 17a), and they saw that Moshe did not
protest nor rebuke them. If that be the case, to enter a fortified land and to
do battle with <span class=SpellE>Amalek</span> without Moshe would be
suicidal! … Therefore does it <span class=GramE>say :</span> 'And Caleb
silenced the people' inasmuch they were attributing everything to Moshe - saying,
do not speak so nor even imagine that victory and miracle are contingent only
upon Moshe&quot;. The <span class=SpellE>Meshech</span> <span class=SpellE>Chochmah</span>
explains the root of the people's ostensible deficiency of faith, of lack of
faith in a people who had been witness to all the miracles in the desert, is
indeed strange. He argues that the Children of Israel had not yet liberated
themselves from their belief in Moshe as a god, a belief which, in its time,
had led to the idolatry at the sin of the calf. Aside from his motivation to
solve the difficulty of the words &quot;about Moshe&quot;, the <span
class=SpellE>Meshech</span> <span class=SpellE>Chochmah</span> is here trying
to cope with the problem of accusing the <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span> - chosen of the
people - of complete distrust. The motivation of fear of entering the land is
much more comprehensible in his eyes within the wider context of the sin of the
calf and the decline into idolatry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>A yet farther
reaching explication is suggested by the philosopher Emanuel <span
class=SpellE>Levinas</span> in his lecture &quot;Promised Land or <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Permissible</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&quot;. Basing himself on the Talmud
in Tractate <span class=SpellE>Sotah</span> 34a, he argues that &quot;it is
possible to understand the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>meraglim</span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>,</span>
that they had pure motives. They asked themselves: By what right are we going
into this land? What moral advantage do we have over the inhabitants settled in
this country?&quot; <span class=GramE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Nine Talmudic
Readings, P. 77)</span>.</span> <span class=SpellE>Levinas</span> argues on the
basis of the Talmudic explication of the words &quot;And Hebron was built seven
years before <span class=SpellE>Zoan</span> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>&quot; <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(13:22)</span>. He claims that the parenthetical statement regarding
the historical precedence of the establishment of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Hebron</st1:place></st1:City> over the building of <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Zoan</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span>
raises the question of our right to expel the inhabitants from their homes.
Caleb's answer, according to the Talmud, is: &quot;He said to them; and is this
all that <span class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Amram</span> did for
us<span class=GramE>?…</span> He took us out of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> and he split the sea for us
and he fed us the manna. If he should say to us, make ladders and climb to the
heavens, would we not obey him?&quot; <span class=SpellE>Levinas</span> reads
Caleb's statement as an attempt to implant faith in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>'s
moral right to inherit the land: &quot;Moshe took us out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on"><span class=GramE>Egypt</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span
class=GramE>,</span> our history begins with the act of liberation. He split
the sea for <span class=GramE>us,</span> he overwhelmed the forces of nature…
Is it conceivable that under his leadership we should conquer a country like
one conquers a colony? Can our act of conquest be an imperialistic act? We are
going - and here the text is extraordinarily explicit - we are going towards
this land in order to experience celestial life. &quot;We shall ascend to
heaven!&quot; We will not possess this land as it is usually possessed; we will
found a just community in the land&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Even though <span
class=SpellE>Levinas's</span> <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>midrash</span></span></span> is a bit
far-fetched, almost bordering on the avant-garde, he turns the argument between
Caleb and the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span>
into a profound debate with practical ramifications. It is not the conquest
itself that the <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span>
fear; they have no doubt that they will succeed. They are apprehensive about
inability to cope with the ethical challenge to follow. <span class=SpellE>Levinas</span>
lights up an imaginary aspect in the internal debate taking place among the <span
class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>meraglim</span></span>
regarding the moral right to conquest of a land and the ethical compass which
should direct life in it. The lecture &quot;Promised Land or <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Permitted</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&quot;
was delivered in <st1:metricconverter ProductID="1965, in" w:st="on">1965, in</st1:metricconverter>
the twilight years of the social and principled ideal which the settlement pioneers
had formulated and exemplified. Since then, the ideal has dissipated. The words
which <span class=SpellE>Levinas</span> placed in the mouth of Caleb <span
class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Yefuneh</span> who believed in the
ability of the Jewish people to conquer the land and to establish a just
society - are silent. They have been replaced by a shallow reading of the text:
&quot;Let us rise up and we shall inherit it, for we shall surely prevail over
it&quot; How shall we prevail over it? <span class=GramE>With force, and, if
necessary, with deviousness and 'combinations'.</span> Last summer saw the
beginning of a spontaneous social movement which instilled in us hope for the
possibility of a return to ideals, to the vision of creation of an exemplary
