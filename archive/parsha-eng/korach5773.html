<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The earliest attempt

Which is the controversy for the sake of Heaven? Every assembly which is with
religious purpose [&quot;<span class=SpellE><i>L'shem</i></span><i> mitzvah&quot;</i>];<i>
</i>every assembly which was with religious purpose<i> </i>was that of the Men
of the Great Assembly, and that not for the sake of religious purpose is the
assembly of the people of the Generation of the Scattering [i.e., the
generation of the Tower of Babel].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The Sages of
this <span class=SpellE>Baraita</span> replaced the concept &quot;<span
class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>shamayim</span></i>&quot;
- &quot;for the sake of Heaven&quot;- with &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i>
mitzvah&quot; - </i>for religious purpose, and in addition, &quot;controversy&quot;
is replaced with &quot;assembly&quot;. The ultimate determinant of the type of
controversy is the goal of the assembly or the controversy. The motivation and
the goal determine whether something is positive or negative; perhaps the <span
class=SpellE>Baraita</span> is teaching that although something may seem at
first to be a divisionary disagreement, as long as it is truly '<span
class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i> mitzvah&quot;</i> it does not damage the
unity, whereas false unity which is not &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i>
mitzvah&quot;, </i>divides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The <span
class=SpellE>Meiri</span>, in his commentary, understands the concept &quot;<span
class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>shamayim</span>&quot; </i>[for
the sake of Heaven] as referring to the manner in which the controversy is
conducted:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>[...] and said
that if the other party responds and differs <b>not in order to vex or to triumph,
but rather to reach the truth, </b>as against &quot;not for the sake of Heaven&quot;;
&quot;not for the sake of Heaven&quot;, is <b>when he responds and differs in
order to anger and to win.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The <span
class=SpellE>Meiri</span>, then, determines the goal of the controversy from the
manner in which it is conducted; one who is really concerned with the truth, and
not concerned primarily with &quot;winning&quot;, will not argue in a vexatious
manner. &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>L'shem</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>shamayim</span>&quot;</i>,
then, is synonymous with conducting controversy with the purpose of determining
the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>R. Obadiah of <span
class=SpellE>Bartinura</span> explains &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>l'shem</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>shamayim</span></i>&quot; in similar fashion, but he emphasizes
not the manner in which the controversy is conducted, but rather its goal:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>And I heard
the word &quot;<b>the end&quot; </b>interpreted as <b>&quot;the goal&quot; </b>of
the controversy. Controversy which is for the sake of Heaven is one which has
as its <b>purpose and desired end the attainment of truth. </b>This exists, as
we have said, <b>when through the controversy the truth becomes clear. </b>And,
as is clear from the controversy between Hillel and <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span>
in which <span class=SpellE>halachic</span> rulings follow the House of Hillel
[Talmudic tradition attributes primacy of Bet Hillel's rulings to their gentlemanly
deportment - Translator's note], but controversy <u>not</u> for the sake of
Heaven has as its desired goal the search for authority and the love of triumph.
This end is not permanent, as we found in the controversy of <span
class=SpellE>Korach</span> and his assembly, where their goal and final intent
was the desire for honor and authority, but the opposite was achieved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The Talmud is
without doubt a book in which 'controversy celebrates', but in reading <span
class=SpellE>Pirke</span> <span class=SpellE>Aboth</span> carefully we note
that the archetype of controversy for the sake of Heaven is the controversy between
<b>Hillel and <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span><i> - </i></b>not the
controversy between their respective disciples, &quot;the House of Hillel&quot;
and &quot;the House of <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span>&quot;, thus teaching
us that man's heart can inject power motives into a controversy which first
began as a search for truth. Indeed, alongside the idyllic picture of the warm
relations between the two schools we find the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>Although Beth <span
class=SpellE>Shammai</span> and Beth Hillel are in disagreement on the questions
of rivals, sisters, an old bill of divorce, a doubtfully married woman, a woman
whom her husband had divorced and who stayed with him over the night in an inn,
money, valuables, a <span class=SpellE><i>perutah</i></span> and the value of a
<span class=SpellE>perutah</span>, <b>Beth <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span>
did not, nevertheless, abstain from marrying women of the families of Beth
Hillel, nor did Beth Hillel refrain from marrying those of Beth <span
class=SpellE>Shammai</span>. This is to teach you that they showed love and
friendship towards one another, thus putting into practice the Scriptural text,
Love ye truth and peace </b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Trac</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Yevamoth</span> 14a),<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The Talmud <span
class=SpellE>Yerushalmi</span> (<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Shabbat 1, 4) </span>tells

class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> does not reveal how Bet <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span>
achieved the majority which resulted in the enactment of a number of their
rulings on that day. In the Talmud <span class=GramE>itself</span> there is a
controversy between R. <span class=SpellE>Eliezer</span> and R. <span
class=SpellE>Yehoshua</span> regarding the way in which these measures should
be evaluated; do they strengthen or do they weaken. But it is absolutely clear
that the opening passage of the discussion &quot;that day was as difficult for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> the day
on which the calf was made&quot;, referring to the violent manner in which the
majority was achieved, expressed dissatisfaction with the silencing of
controversy and argument between the two schools. Indeed, Tractate <span
class=SpellE>Sotah</span> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(47b) </span>quotes a
statement - originating in the <span class=SpellE>Tosefta</span> - which views
the controversy as resulting from lack of proper preparation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>&quot;With the
increase of disciples of <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span> and <span

dissension increased in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Torah became like two Toroth&quot;. It is possible, however, that this
statement disparages not the existence of controversy <i>per se</i>, but even
hints at the <span class=SpellE>Yerushalmi</span> story relating to the manner
in which the controversy deteriorated into violence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In
contradiction to this statement, there exists another famous one in Tractate. <span
class=SpellE>Haggiga</span> (<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>3b)</span> in praise
of controversy:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>And he [R. <span
class=SpellE>Elazar</span> b. <span class=SpellE>Azaria</span>] also took up
the text and expounded: &quot;The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails
well planted are the words of <b>masters of Assemblies</b>, which are given
from one Shepherd&quot;. Why are the words of the Torah likened to a goad? To
teach you that just as the goad directs the heifer along its furrow in order to
bring forth life to the world, so the words of the Torah direct those who study
them from the paths of death to the paths of life. But [should you think] that
just as the goad is movable so the words of the Torah are movable; therefore
the text says: 'nails'. But [should you think] that just as the nail diminishes
and does not increase, so too the words of the Torah diminish and do not
increase; therefore the text says 'well planted'; just as a plant grows and
increases, so the words of the Torah grow and increase. 'The masters of
assemblies': these are the disciples of the wise, who sit in manifold
assemblies [lit. &quot;assemblies <span class=SpellE>assemblies</span>&quot;]
and occupy themselves with the Torah, some pronouncing 'clean' and others
pronouncing 'unclean', some prohibiting and others permitting, some
disqualifying and others declaring fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>Should a man
say: How in these circumstances can I learn Torah? Therefore the text says: 'All
of them are given from one Shepherd'. One God gave them; one leader uttered
them from the mouth of the Lord of all creation, blessed be He; for it is
written: 'And God spoke all these words'. Also you make your ear like the
hopper and get you a perceptive heart to understand the words of those who
pronounce unclean and the words of those who pronounce clean, the words of
those who prohibit and the words of those who permit, the words of those who
disqualify and the words of those who declare fit.<span lang=HE dir=RTL><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>&quot;Who sit
in assemblies <span class=SpellE>assemblies</span>&quot; - the repetition is
intended to point out two kinds of assembly, one material and the second
spiritual; that the two unite in their soul to direct everything toward a
single source, to the ways of the Oneness and the goal of study for its sake,
so it seems to me. And when they convene with this intent, some ruling that
something is impure and others declaring it clean, the unity and the love from
all the extremes will increase if there rests upon them the light of Torah, its
secrets will be revealed to them and they will be like saplings &quot;well
planted&quot;, and this is what is written &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>V'et</i></span><i>

translated &quot;Against <span class=SpellE>Waheb</span> in a whirlwind&quot;,

of this controversy is to increase love and unity. This, then, is the [R. <span
class=SpellE>Elazar</span> b. <span class=SpellE>Azariah's</span>] explanation:
Lest one say, 'How can I study Torah from now on?', because without
understanding the intended goal, controversy would seem to be a dividing factor,
and how can both sides continue to exist? Therefore does it (<span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Tosefta</span></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> <span class=SpellE>Sotah</span> 7, 12) </span>teach
us &quot;All were given by a single shepherd, one God gave them, one leader
spoke them, all from the Master of all creation, blessed <span class=GramE>be</span>
He. This refers to our words above, because they have a single source, and one
God gave them, etc., from the Master of all creation, blessed be He. <span
class=GramE>And just as the purpose of Creation was criticized by some at the
time of Creation.</span> They too were created in order to achieve the Blessed
One's uniqueness and unity, for He is one and His name is one, and so did the
Torah effect wholeness, for through the sages' disputes light was increased and
they comprehended its truth that the Torah is a single, complete, and true
entity. And this is what the Sages <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>said (<span
class=SpellE>Aboth</span> 5, 17</span>) &quot;Every controversy which is in the
name of Heaven is destined to result in something permanent&quot; because its
purpose is <b>the purpose of existence and of unity.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>According to
this elucidation, controversy, when conducted in the name of Heaven, is not
only for the sake of clarifying the truth but also for the purpose of achieving
true unity, as expressed in the wonderful words of <span class=SpellE>Rav</span>
Kook in <span class=SpellE>Olat</span> <span class=SpellE>R'iyah</span> (<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>p. 330)</span> in reference to &quot;Scholars increase
peace throughout the world&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Some
mistakenly think that world peace cannot be established unless through a single
hue of opinions and attributes, and therefore when they see scholars delving
into wisdom and Torah knowledge, and their study results in a proliferation of
positions and approaches, they think that they [the scholars] are causing
controversy and the opposite of peace.<b> </b>This is not true, for true peace
can come to the world only through the <b>multiplicity of peace. </b>The
multiplicity of peace means that all sides and approaches be seen, and it will
become clear that all have a place, each according to its value, its place, and
its matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>At the
beginning of Tractate <span class=SpellE>Gittin</span> (<span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>6b) </span>the Talmud records a meeting between R. <span class=SpellE>Abiathar</span>
and the prophet Elijah:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>R. <span
class=SpellE>Abiathar</span> soon afterwards came across Elijah and said to
him:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>'What is the
Holy One, blessed be He, doing?' and he answered, 'He is discussing the
question of the concubine in <span class=SpellE>Gibea</span>.' 'What does He
say?' Said Elijah: '[He says], <span class=GramE><b>My</b></span><b> son <span
class=SpellE>Abiathar</span> says So-and-so, and my son Jonathan says
So-and-so,</b>' Said R. <span class=SpellE>Abiathar</span>: 'Can there possibly
be uncertainty in the mind of the Heavenly One?' He replied: <b>Both [answers]
are the words of the living God. <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Perhaps this
dialogue between R. <span class=SpellE>Abiathar</span> and Elijah - who
represents Heaven in determining that &quot;Both are the words of the living
God&quot; - echoes a discussion in Tractate <span class=SpellE>Eruvin</span> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(13b</span>) regarding the controversies between Bet
Hillel and Bet <span class=SpellE>Shammai</span>: &quot;Both these and these
are the words of the living God&quot;. <span class=GramE>(My thanks to Rabbi
Benny Lau who called my attention to this link).</span> Even in Heaven
controversy has representation, i.e., the Heavenly vision encompasses this <b>complexity</b>,
and this being so, it may be that &quot;controversy in the name of Heaven&quot;
is that controversy which brings us closer to the complex and encompassing
vision which exists in &quot;Heaven&quot;. May it be His will that we be wise
enough to conduct the most important and most difficult controversies in a
spirit of mutual respect, for the sake of clarifying the truth, and thereby we
will succeed - if only in small measure - in accomplishing R. <span
