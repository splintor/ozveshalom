passed from Yaakov to Moshe, for without doubt our forefathers dwelt in <st1:place

class=SpellE>Bereishit</span> <st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>:<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">2</st1:PersonName>6) </span>has always been a cause for bewilderment.
&quot;The Lord said&quot; appears in the singular. What does He say? <b>Let us
make, in our image, by our likeness - </b>in the plural! Although &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Elohim</span>&quot; [Hebrew for &quot;the Lord&quot;] is in the
plural mode, in essence it is singular. &quot;<b>You </b>[singular form]
yourself were shown to know <span class=GramE>that</span> God <b>He </b>is the
Elohim, there is <b>none beside Him</b>&quot; (<span class=SpellE><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Devarim</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>
4:35). </span>He who is &quot;<b>none beside Him&quot; - </b>to whom does He
say &quot;<b>Let us make&quot;? </b>With whom does He intend to create a human?
Is &quot;<b>Let us make&quot;</b> but a conventional form designating, as it
were, prior planning, which does not at all imply any partners in the act of
creation of which it is written &quot;And the Lord <b>created [</b>singular]
the human in <b>His</b> image...&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>:<st1:PersonName w:st="on">2</st1:PersonName>7</span>)?
He alone, a one and only creator, says &quot;<b>Let us create&quot; - in the
plural-</b> is this to teach us proper behavior; i.e. that even He, exalted
above all men, consults with his entourage, even if only for the sake of
appearance. <span class=GramE>No doubt an edifying explanation, but hardly '<span
class=SpellE><i>p'shat</i></span><i>' - </i>literal understanding.</span> And
if we do wish to expound homiletically - <span class=SpellE><i>drash</i></span><i>
-</i> a more feasible explanation would be as follows: Even though the Creator
is a sole creator, <b>he involves the created one himself in the process of
bringing His creation to fruition.</b> <b>Let us make a human, </b>I and you, I
and the human whom I will create will create a human, not I and a celestial
entourage, not I and angels on high, <b>I together with man! </b><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>[</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Translator's
note: The Hebrew &quot;<i>Adam</i>&quot; is both a proper noun and a species - man.
Modern gender-sensitive translators prefer to translate <span class=GramE><i>adam</i></span><i>

margin-left:42.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>And the Lord God
fashioned from the soil each beast of the field and each fowl of the heavens

w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>9</span>). God brings his nameless and undefined
creations to the human, and asks him to autonomously complete creation by
giving names. The name is not only a term of identification. The name is the
identity itself. And God, the creator, authorizes man, His partner, to bestow
upon each creation its name, or, if you will, its essence. &quot;<span

nicely until coming up against a seemingly impassable obstacle, &quot;...but
for the human being no sustainer beside him was to be found&quot; <span

and here he finds only <b>him, </b>but he does not find <b>them. </b>What name
in the world can express the identity of a being whose essence is <b>he </b>and
<b>they as </b>one? &quot;Adam&quot;? Only &quot;Adam&quot;! There is no other.
But this <b>he-they</b> is nameless. <b>He</b> is in need of a counterpart
name, not opposite him, but alongside him, and <b>they</b> are in need of a
counterpart name. This is the essence. But what name is there for a <b>being
alongside a being</b> which is a single being? A sense of offense wafts in the
air, not formulated in words but with weighty presence, until the Lord himself,
as it were, cannot ignore it. Immediately - :&quot;And the Lord cast a deep
slumber on the human...&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<st1:PersonName

He takes one of his ribs, and builds it into a woman possessing exceptional understanding,
brings her to the man who has remained frozen in his journey of name-calling,
and he, half a being, astounded, says, &quot;...This one at last, bone of my
bones and flesh of my flesh, <b>this one shall be called woman&quot;. </b>He
gives a name to that <b>it-they </b>and thereby as partner with the Creator - completes
that <b>he </b>and that<b> she, </b>the man and the woman, the mutual
alongside, and from here on <b>Adam - Man </b>is the expression of his essence,

is <b>Adam - man.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.2pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>From the above it is clear that the clarification of the meaning of the
name and its carrier are of special interest. Facing the burning bush in the
desert stands a lone man to whom God has revealed himself and charged with a super-human
mission - to liberate a nation of slaves from the Egyptian super-power and to
lead them to worship Him in the <span class=GramE>promised land</span>. Moshe
sees, Moshe hears, Moshe is dumbstruck by the revelation. When he will come
before the millions of slaves and choose - if, indeed, he will so choose - to
share the hypnotic experience he has experienced, will they trust him? Will
they blindly follow his vision? They will ask him <span class=GramE><b>what is
the essence of God</b> who revealed himself in fire</span>. &quot;And Moshe
said to God, 'Look, when I come to the Israelites and say to them, &quot;The
God of your fathers has sent me to you&quot;, and they will say to me, <span
class=GramE><b>What</b></span><b> is His name?&quot; </b>what shall I say to
them?&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 3:<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>3</span>). God replies that His name is &quot; '<span
class=SpellE><i>Ehyeh-'Asher-'Ehyeh</i></span><i>&quot; - </i>&quot;I-Will-Be-Who-I-Will-Be&quot;
and He said, Thus shall you say to the Israelites, ' '<span class=SpellE><b><i>Ehyeh</i></b></span>

all past and all future, that is his eternal name or essence.</p>

of the Judges, the despairing Israelite's hope lay in the prayer that some day
his children will bring light into his life. <span class=SpellE>Manoach's</span>

came to him with the exciting message that &quot;A man of God came to me, and
he looked like an angel of God, very frightening. I did not ask him where he

rather that our lives, the good and the bad, all that befalls us, be the result
