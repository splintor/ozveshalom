<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Moshe descends Mt. Sinai, and to his
amazement he finds the people in the midst of worship of a golden calf, led by
none other than by his brother Aharon. In anger, Moshe smashes the tablets,
burns the calf, grinds it to dust, casts it upon the waters and gives the
Children of Israel to drink. But this is not enough. The people are still out
of control: <i>&quot;And Moshe saw that the people were out of control, since
Aharon had let them get out of control, so that they were a menace to any who
might oppose them.&quot;</i> (<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Shemot 32:25</span>).
What exactly did Aharon do to the people? Says Ramban: &quot;For Aharon had let
them get out of control - he released them from all advice and rebuke, and they
were like sheep dispersed on the mountains <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(I
Kings, 22:17</span>) without counselor or guide.&quot; Their despairing of
Moshe, the fashioning of the calf and the ecstatic dancing around it, and the
destruction of the calf by Moshe, all these left the people in a state of total
disarray - &quot;he released them from all advice and rebuke&quot;. The people
had lost their moral and religious compass, &quot;like sheep dispersed on the
mountains&quot;; according to many Midrashim, they engaged in idol worship. In
this difficult situation, which he had not encountered from the time he came to
know the people, Moshe rises to leadership and takes the following extreme<i> </i>steps:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><i>Moshe stood up in the gate of the camp and
said, &quot;Whoever is for the Lord, come here!&quot; And all the Levites
rallied to him. He said to them, &quot;Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:
Each of you put sword on thigh, go back and forth from gate to gate throughout
the camp, and slay brother, neighbor, and kin.&quot; The Levites did as Moshe
had bidden; and some three thousand of the people fell on that day. And Moshe
said: &quot;Dedicate yourselves to the Lord this day - for each of you has been
against son and brother - that He may bestow a blessing upon you today.&quot; </i><i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>32:26-29)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Moshe cries out the cry of zealotry: &quot;Whoever
is for God - to me!&quot; which many years later will be echoed by Mattityahu
the Hashmonean, after killing the Hellenist on the altar at Modiin. Those who
heed Moshe's call, the sons of Levi, embark upon a round of exceptionally
brutal punishment, in which they are charged to &quot;<i> slay brother,
neighbor, and kin.&quot; </i>The Levite zealots go to the extent of killing
their own sons, as can be learned from Moshe's words &quot;<i>each of you has
been against son and brother&quot; </i>(Rashbam definitely understood the plain
meaning [pshat]<i> </i>as he wrote: &quot;You sent your hands, man against <u>his
son</u> and against his brother, for the sake of heaven&quot;). According to
the Midrash, this willingness to kill relatives and friends is the subject of
the passage referring to Levi in the Parasha &quot;V'zot haberacha&quot;: &quot;<i>Who
said of his father and mother, &quot;I consider them not.&quot; His brothers he
disregarded, ignored his own children. Your precepts alone they observed, and
kept Your covenant.&quot; </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Devarim 32:9</span>).
From here we learn that the sons of Levi killed not only their children and
brothers, but also their fathers and mothers.(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>According
to the Talmud, since it is written that <u>all </u>the sons of Levi answered
Moshe's call, it is impossible that that there were idolaters among the sons of
Levi, and therefore it cannot be that the fathers and mothers they killed
belonged to the tribe of Levi. From this we adduce that the reference is to the
father of the mother, maternal step-brothers, grandchildren via the daughter -
who are not considered Levites (Yoma, 62b) - but this is certainly not the
peshat.</span>) This the nature of such punitive operations; what begins as an
order to kill brothers, relatives and neighbors, ends with the indiscriminate
slaughter of brothers, parents and sons.(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>It
cannot be argued that parents and children are included in 'kin', for one's tie
to his child is much stronger that his tie to his brother, and if Moshe's
intent was that they also kill the sons, he would have said so expressly.</span>)
We are not surprised that those capable of such wholesale slaughter are
descendants of Levi, who led the campaign of vengeance in Shechem, those whose &quot;<i>weapons
are tools of lawlessness.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>I wish to raise two questions regarding Moshe's
behavior in this incident. First, Moshe bases his behavior upon the divine
command &quot;<i>Thus says the Lord... each of you, put sword on thigh, etc.&quot;
</i>- but the text records no evidence of such a command. Secondly, Moshe's
cruel and vengeful order does not seem consonant with his efforts to achieve
atonement for the sin immediately afterwards - &quot;<i>Now, if You will
forgive their sin [well and good]; but if not, erase me from the record which
You have written.&quot; </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(32:32</span>) Why
could not Moshe have sought to pacify God and present his 'ultimatum' before
the slaughter by the sons of Levi? These questions were asked by the Darshanim,
and one of them suggests the following sequence of events: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>He [Moshe] said before Him: Master of the
Universe, have you before you only the measure of law for all the inhabitants
of the world and for all of your creations upon earth? Shall I descend and
apply the measure of the law - and if they worshipped it with full heart shall
they all perish in a single day? He descended, took the calf and burned it in
fire, as is written &quot;<i>He took the calf... and Moshe stood in the gate...
and said to them, So said God , etc.&quot;<u> </u></i><u>I call upon heaven and
earth to testify that The Holy One, Blessed Be He, did not tell Moshe</u> to
stand in the gate of the camp and proclaim 'Who is for God - unto me' and to
say 'So said the Lord, God of Israel' - but rather Moshe was a tzaddik and he
learned for himself a <i>kal va'chomer -</i> If I say to Israel, let one kill
his brother and his neighbor and his kin, <u>Israel will say, Did you not teach
us that a Sanhedrin which executes one soul in seven years is called
destructive, how do you kill three thousand in one day?</u> Therefore, Moshe
ascribed the command to the Glory above, as is written, '<i>So said the Lord,
etc&quot;... </i>then Moshe the tzaddik returned and stood before The Holy One,
Blessed Be He, in prayer. He said to Him, Master of the Universe, you are a
tzaddik and a hassid, and everything you do is in good faith. Because of three
thousand who worshipped the calf with full heart, shall six hundred thousand<i>
-</i> plus those of twenty years of age and younger, and those eighteen years
old and those fifteen years old, and ten, and two, and one, and many aliens and
slaves who joined them - perish!? There will be no end to this. Immediately God
was filled with mercy and was appeased. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Eliyahu
Rabba [Ish Shalom] Parasha 4, beginning with &quot;Why did he merit&quot;)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>According to this Midrash, the campaign of
zealotry and killing was not carried out for the sake of vengeance and
punishment, but in order to appease the anger of The Holy One, Blessed Be He.
To accomplish this, Moshe thought to punish only those who were directly and
totally involved in the sin of the calf, and thereby to save the rest of the
people (who had certainly also sinned!) from the decree &quot;<i>Let my anger
blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them&quot; </i>There is, then,
a direct connection between &quot;<i>Who is for God - to me!&quot; </i>and<i> &quot;Perhaps
I shall atone for their sin.&quot; </i>This and more: God did not order the
above punitive operation; it was Moshe's initiative which was intended to
subdue God's anger and to show Him that the real sinners had been punished
according to the full letter of the law. The reason the Midrash gives for Moshe's
ascribing &quot;<i>and slay brother and neighbor, etc</i>.&quot; to God<i> </i>is
that had he issued the order in his own name, the people would have protested
and argued on the basis of the Mishna which says that a Sanhedrin which
executes one person in seven years is &quot;destructive&quot;. This rationale
is instructive, in that it no doubt expresses the <i>darshan's </i>reflections
regarding the ostensible contradiction between the serious concern for human
life - as expressed in the Mishna in Sanhedrin - and the disregard for human
life as expressed in the massacre of &quot;<i>three thousand in a single day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent dir=LTR style='text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:normal'>According
to this explanation, then, Moshe was not carrying out a divine order; his
desire was not to take revenge upon the sinner (otherwise he would have
accepted the suggestion to annihilate the nation, for all had participated in
the sin). His sole intent was to save the Jewish people and to conciliate
between them and their heavenly father. The words placed in Moshe's mouth by
the Midrash indicate how deep was his mercy and love for the Children of
Israel, and his concern that they not be judged unfairly: &quot;Because of
three thousand who worshipped the calf with full heart, shall six hundred
thousand<i> -</i> plus those of twenty years of age and younger, and those
eighteen years old and fifteen years old, and ten, and two, and one - perish!?&quot;
But if Moshe was so fearful for those of ten, two, and one, how could he have
ordered the sons of Levi to indiscriminately kill their brothers and relatives?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent dir=LTR style='text-indent:21.3pt;line-height:normal'>In
conclusion, I would like to suggest that Moshe was indeed not at ease with the
order he gave; he was unable to accept its terrible results. This finds
expression in his impotence in coping with a surprisingly similar situation -
the predicament of idolatry and sexual license with the daughters of Moav,
described at the end of Parashat Balak. In this case, Moshe does not stand in
the gate and cry out &quot;Who is for God - to me!!&quot; He weeps by the
entrance to the Tent of Appointment. The sight before him certainly reminds him
of the unbridled and abandoned behavior of the people at the sin of the calf; but
his traumatic experience at having killed three thousand people in a single day
paralyzes him. All he can do is to weep. Civil war is no longer an option he is
willing to consider.</p>

covenant, all sanctity is lifted from them, and they are like a profane object
defiled by a robber. Titus entered the Holy of Holies and was not harmed, for
its sanctity had previously been removed. <b>Yet more, the tablets, engraved by
the hand of God, were not in themselves holy, but only for you whenever you
observe that which is written upon them . . . for nothing in creation has
inherent holiness; its holiness is contingent upon Israel's observance of the
Torah . . . all the holy sites have no basis in our religion, -- they are holy

fair and just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an
option but an imperative.</p>
