direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
parasha presents us with the web of Rachel's relations with Leah. The story of
the mandrakes, which follows the birth of the maidservants' sons, is the climax
of the tension in their relations. Rachel asks Leah to give her some of the
mandrakes brought by Leah's son, Reuven. Leah's answer to the request is sharp
and stinging - &quot;<i>Was it not enough for you to take away my husband, that
you would also take my son's mandrakes?!&quot; </i>This answer seems totally
out of proportion to Rachel's request, a request which is not marked by
tension; it even has elements of softness and search for pity. Leah's barbed
response indicates that she had been long waiting to fling that accusation at
Rachel; sisterly communication had been, up to this point, sorely inadequate.
Leah's answer, in which she reveals her view on the triangular relations
between herself and her sister and her husband, become <b><u>the</u> </b>turning
point in Rachel's attitude to Leah. A second before this sentence was spoken,
Rachel is deep in emotional crisis, involved with herself, with her anguish,
with her envy of her sister, and mainly with her anger at Leah for having taken
her place alongside Yaakov. Until this moment, Rachel saw all life through the
perspective of her conflict with her sister. She was bound by her point of view
that Leah behaved arbitrarily, wounding her again and again throughout her
relationship with Yaakov, beginning with the wedding night in which she
collaborated in their father's deceit, and concluding with having children -
both she and her maidservant - as though with malicious intent to pain
childless Rachel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Leah's
reply stuns her. <b>The few words which Leah utters &quot;<i>Was it not enough
for you to take away my husband?!</i>&quot;<i> </i>lays bare before Rachel
Leah's world and the way she conceives reality. </b>Rachel understands that
Leah senses herself rejected and wounded, unloved and abandoned. Leah has been
long awaiting an opportunity to hurl blame upon Rachel, certain that Rachel is
aware of her suffering, of the hell which she undergoes lacking expressions of
love by Yaakov. After having inwardly spoken words of rebuke and reprimand
through all the years, it seemed fit in Leah's eyes to respond to Rachel's
minor request for mandrakes with a direct attack. This, then, is the connection
to the deal &quot;mandrakes for a night with Yaakov&quot; which Rachel suggests.
Rachel realizes, for the first time, that there is no point in continuing the
conflict; there is no sense in fanning the animosity and no point in
monopolizing Yaakov, who is married to both of them and who is the subject of
their fight for his affections. Only at this point, after Leah lays bare the
configuration of her world before Rachel, does Rachel understand Leah, and
actively participate in the attempt to bring her closer to Yaakov; therefore
she suggests that she spend with Yaakov the night which was intended for her.
It seems that Chazal's famous Midrashic attempt to move Rachel's realization
and sacrifice up to an earlier date, having Rachel give her signs to Leah on
the wedding night, is not in line with the chapter's dramatic progression of
the plot. At first, Rachel requested the mandrakes in order to facilitate
conception, but after Leah's eruption, they become the instrument of Rachel's
detachment from Yaakov. Therefore Chazal expounded: &quot;Because she made
light of the tzaddik's closeness, she did not merit burial alongside him.&quot;
At first glance, it is difficult to understand why Rachel, the beloved, is
denied interment alongside her husband only because she gave up a single night
of his company - and that, for the benefit of his other legal wife. (Attention
should be paid to the connection between cohabitation and death, as expressed
by the shared root sh'kh'v'). But the point is that at the moment Rachel
understands her sister's position, she ceases to experience reality solely
through her relations with Yaakov. The moment she realizes that her animosity
towards her sister is unfounded and she forgoes any contest over Yaakov, she is
transformed into an autonomous person. The meaning of her severance from
conjugality is that she no longer is dependent upon Yaakov for her
self-realization; she sets out upon a new path of <b>her</b> choosing. This
behavior results in criticism by Chazal; she is justly sentenced - in that cave
of Machpela where couples are buried, there is no place for Rachel, who
renounced conjugality. Leah, on the other hand, does not undergo such a process
- she continues to maintain her perspective and finds it difficult to
appreciate her sister's distress and the processes she is experiencing; Leah is
still Yaakov's &quot;helpmeet&quot;, and she submits her desires to his wishes,
and therefore it is she who merits to buried alongside him. What is happening
to Rachel - the transformation from the beloved and the &quot;helpmeet&quot; to
an independent woman can be detected in the names assigned her sons. Before her
awareness of Leah's point of view, the names reflect Rachel's anger and her
struggle with her sister: Dan - &quot;<i>God has vindicated me&quot; - </i>the
birth is a ruling in Rachel's favor; Naftali - &quot;<i>A fateful contest I
waged with my sister; yes, and I have prevailed&quot; - </i>the name speaks for
itself. After understanding Leah's viewpoint, she calls her son Yosef - &quot;<i>May
the Lord add another son for me&quot; - </i>the name relates only to her
maternal longings, or &quot;<i>God has taken away my disgrace&quot; - </i>an
expression of resignation, of self-awareness, a declaration of weakness, all
these in contrast to feelings of jealousy and quarrel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rachel
becomes pregnant thanks to divine interest in her barrenness - &quot;<i>Now God
took note of Rachel; God heeded her and opened her womb&quot;. </i>Here, too,
we find Chazal's explication to the effect that &quot;He remembered that she
gave her [to Leah] signs and that she was fearful lest she fall to Esav should
Yaakov reject her&quot; contradicts the narrative line. God's taking note of
Rachel is juxtaposed to the story of the mandrakes; it flows logically from
Rachel's understanding of Leah and of her noble concession. (It is interesting
to note that although Chazal draw comparisons between Rachel and Chana, in the
case of Chana and Penina there is no parallel awareness of the other's
perception of reality). God takes note of Rachel <u>after she has decided</u>
to change direction, navigating her life according to her own conscience and
wishes, and not in accordance with society's standards. <i>Davka</i> now is she
able to imagine life without Yaakov. <i>Davka</i> now apprehension of rejection
by Yaakov (&quot;should Yaakov reject her&quot;) does not guide her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
final point. The change in Rachel's relations with Yaakov and with her sister
can be seen both at the beginning and at the end of the process. At the
beginning, Rachel says to Yaakov &quot;<i>Give me children or I shall
die&quot;. </i>Rachel is in a situation in which she perceives Yaakov as the
one responsible for her barrenness; should she not meet his expectations, her
life will have no meaning. At the beginning Rachel experiences the desire for
motherhood as part of the wish to compete with her sister and to meet her
husband's expectation. Yet more, &quot;Yaakov&quot; is the &quot;Baal&quot; and
the god who has the power to grant her pregnancy. Yaakov refuses to take
responsibility and play the role which Rachel assigns him; he admonishes her -
&quot;<i>Can I take the place of God?&quot; </i>At the end of the process, an
inversion transpires. After Laban overtakes Yaakov and charges him with
stealing his gods, Yaakov declares that &quot;<i>anyone with whom you find your
gods shall not remain alive!&quot; </i>Here, Yaakov does not say &quot;<i>Can I
take the place of God?&quot; - </i>he takes responsibility for all that happens
under his aegis. At this point, however, Rachel no longer perceives her life as
subsidiary to Yaakov and as an object of his expectations. She lies regarding
the idols, and thereby renounces Yaakov's ability to rule over her life. Also
the manner in which she does this - sitting on the idols with the excuse &quot;<i><u>for
the way of women is upon me</u>&quot;</i> - hints at her newly acquired
strength, to the point of manipulative use of her feminine distinctiveness.
Thus, she is transformed from one who perceives herself as totally dependent
upon Yaakov to one who is in complete control of her life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3 dir=LTR>That short sentence spoken by Leah exposed
Rachel to the hopelessness of her earlier perceptions, and liberated her from
the turbulence of her inner world. Her attentive listening to her sister
enabled her to exploit the one-time opportunity to effect far-reaching changes
in her life and to extend a hand to her sister. On a higher level, the logic of
the story indicates that the process of her liberation was, simultaneously,
both the key to the cessation of her barrenness, and the reason for the heavy
price she paid for her emancipation from Yaakov.</p>

is the area which cannot be approached and controlled directly; therefore,
'holiness of a site' implies the prohibition against transforming the place
into a tool for human exploitation. The sanctity of a synagogue is expressed
also through the prohibition against using the synagogue space as a shortcut,
in the words of the Mishna: &quot;One may not enter the Temple Mount with his
staff, his sandal, his moneybelt and with the dust on his feet, and he shall
not use it as a shortcut.&quot; Essentially, <i>kedusha,</i> in its various
halakhic expressions, means withdrawal and retreat. Its goal - the limitation
of domination and dominion. According to most Halakhic masters, the area of the
Temple Mount itself, is, because of its sanctity, off limits to entry by Jews.
How can one claim ownership of a place where his foot may not tread?!...
Without doubt, the tremendous effort exerted by each side to wave its national
flag over the mount is the 'placing of an idol in the sanctuary' and the
changing of a holy place into an area of manipulation in a national conflict. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
