<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Our <i>parasha</i>
begins with the command to appoint judges and officials<sup>1</sup>. The
subject under discussion is the <i>mitzvah</i> to establish an enlightened and
effective legal system. Perhaps the actual goal is a comprehensive
economic-political-legal system capable of improving men's' lives collectively
so as to justify their description as a community &quot;in the image of God&quot;.
It can be definitely said that God commands <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> to establish what we term
today &quot;rule of law&quot;. It seems that this is more or less how Ramban
understood the word &quot;<i>mishpat&quot; </i>(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Leviticus
18:4):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>&quot;My laws
you shall do&quot; - 'These are things written in the Torah which, were they
not to have appeared, it would have appropriate to say them', thus in the words
of Rashi. [...] But according to the plain meaning &quot;<i>mishpatai&quot; - </i>&quot;my
laws&quot;, according to its simple meaning, [refers to] the laws appearing in
the <i>parasha</i> of &quot;<i>V'eleh HaMishpatim&quot; - </i>&quot;And These
Are the Laws&quot; and throughout the Torah, and therefore it says &quot;which
man shall live by them&quot; - for the laws were given <b>for the life of men
living in communities and for the welfare of man, </b>and so that man not
injure his fellow nor kill him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Being that the
command to appoint judges is the <i>mitzvah</i> to establish rule of law, it is
bound up tightly with another <i>mitzvah</i> that obliges many more people to
establish rule of law: the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>dinim - </i>of establishing
courts and laws - of the descendents of Noah, i.e., the Noahide laws. (Today
the descendents of Noah number approximately seven billion, Jews making up
about 0.2%). Both Jews and gentiles are commanded by God to establish
governments of law and justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>What is the
relation between the Jewish government of law and that of the children of Noah?
Needless to say, this is a complex and complicated question. In my opinion, a
deep truth is to be found in the approach of Rav Hayyim Hirshenson who
considered the commandment to appoint judges to be a special Jewish version of
universal <i>mitzvah </i>of <i>denim - </i>of laws. He opined that every
enlightened nation embodies its unique version:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>[...] and thus
all segments of humanity create for themselves rules and regulations <span
dir=RTL></span><span lang=HE dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span>'</span><b>which Man
shall create and live by. </b>There is no difference whether these laws were
made through national concurrence, such as with the American constitution, or
on the advice of a political sage, as in the case Lycurgus and Spartan law, or
by divine command, such as the laws of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> [...] their primary goal is
organization and decorum for the sake of human and national existence [...] <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<b>Musagei Shav V'ha'emmet </b>p. 71)</span>.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>All the above
simply means that God desires the improvement of man - every man, everywhere - by
means of the rule of law. This is reason that He commanded the Jews to
establish the rule of law by means of judges, and so did He command those not
Jewish, i.e., 99.8% of humanity, through the <i>mitzvah </i>of <i>dinim </i>[the
requirement of maintaining courts to provide legal recourse]. If we wish to
fulfill God's will, we should try to clarify if there is, indeed, any chance
that the rule of law and justice can exist throughout the world. Does this not
sound like a crazy dream?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>But if we
observe the development of man from an evolutionary viewpoint, we see that men
do march towards the reality of universal rule by law with remarkable speed.
According to Yuval Harari (<b>Kitzur Toldot Ha'enoshut), </b>humans<b> </b>were
once &quot;hunter-gatherers&quot;, organized into groups of about 150 people
who knew each other<b> </b>personally. Today, according to the index of the
respected economic magazine &quot;The Economist&quot;, about a half of the
human race lives in &quot;democracies&quot; or &quot;flawed democracies&quot;.
These are nations which maintain developed government of law, interwoven with
each other through international law and cultural and trade relations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>This and more.
Today, the absolute majority of men live in countries committed - either fully
or partially - to &quot;The International Bill of Rights&quot;, which is
composed of the universal proclamation regarding human rights, which was
adopted after the holocaust, and two treaties, one devoted to &quot;civil and
national&quot; rights, and the other to 'economic, social and cultural&quot;
rights. This is to say that despite all the horrors and failures of the human
race, half the people live in countries which maintain some more or less proper
version of the reign of law, and many more live in countries which have
committed themselves to respect the rule of law in the form civil rights laws,
even though in practice they may not do so. We have, therefore, come a long way
since the time a community would contain up until about 150 members who knew
each other personally. Something is happening among people. True, for a large
segment of humanity, the world order remains murderous and brutal to an
unimaginable degree. And it may also be that the little bit of positive order
achieved will be swallowed up in the depths of chaos and violence. But in light
of evolutionary development, there is also a chance that we are on the way to
an all-humanity rule of law based on, among other things, the rights of man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Are we, the
chosen people dwelling in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zion</st1:place></st1:City>,
also obligated to support the common effort for the advancement of the reign of
global rule of law? If it is clear that God wants rule of law for all men, is
it not self-understood that our Torah commands us to act in this direction? In
today's cultural climate, I suspect that the answers on the tongues of many are
likely to be quite embarrassing. Fortunately, the captains of the State of
Israel spared us this embarrassment when they announced and signed before the
entire world that the Jewish State is committed to international law, including
human rights, and even stated in its declaration of independence that the
Israeli government will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations which is also based, among other things, upon human rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>According to
some important halachic decisors, including Rav Hirschenson, this public
commitment of the Jewish state commits us according to Torah law. The violation
of a covenant cut with the nations is viewed by the Torah as a serious
transgression, as can be shown by the penalty imposed for the violation of the
covenant with the Givonites <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(I Shmuel 21:1-9). </span>(Unfortunately,
a penalty such as this cannot be instituted today because of a conflict with
the law on human rights!) R. Hirschenson and others of his school, enlist many
halachic proofs to prove that which should be self-evident: God also want Jews
to contribute their share to the world reign of law and justice. In R.
Hirschenson's words <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<b>Ela Divrei HaBerit, </b>vol.
I, p.69)</span>: &quot;It is forbidden for the Jewish people to violate
international law, even though they are not according the laws of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>&quot; and &quot;Forefend that <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
be considered in the eyes of the nations to be murderous savages opposing
international law and laws of civilization&quot;. There is no doubt that in our
day, according to this approach, the Torah obligates us to observe
international law on human rights. This being the case, when a God-fearing
person seeks to know the will of God, he will search not only in the Talmud,
but also in the universal declaration on human rights and in the two
accompanying treaties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>These words
shed light on the meaning of the words &quot;the beginning of the flowering of
our redemption&quot; appearing in the Prayer for the Welfare of the State.
These words emphasize the great importance of the rebirth of the Israelite
nation in the holy land. They say that the establishment of the modern Jewish
State is <b>the beginning</b> of the flowering of our redemption. What, then,
is the continuation of the redemption? An answer is given in the last section
of the prayer as it appears in the prayer books: &quot;Shine forth in your
glorious majesty on all the inhabitants of your universe&quot;. These words
direct us to the Prophets. Thus the Prayer for the Welfare of the State expresses
an idea found also in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>'s
Declaration of Independence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>The State of
Israel [...] will be based on the foundations of liberty, justice and peace in
the light of the vision of the Prophets of Israel.&quot; In light of the
importance of international law in general and human rights in particular in
the realization of the will of God, we can understand why the Declaration,
immediately following mention of the vision of the Prophets of Israel,
continues with &quot;[the State of Israel] will maintain complete equality of
political and social rights for all its citizens without difference of
religion, race, and gender; will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience,
language, education and culture; will protect the holy sites of all religions;
and will be loyal to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>From the above we conclude that
the establishment of the State of Israel was the beginning of the flowering of
our redemption; the next stage is a world order of law and human rights. The <i>mitzvah
</i>which opens our parasha, &quot;Judges and officials shall you appoint in
all your gates&quot; reflects God's will for improvement of man, every man,
everywhere - by means of the reign of law. May it be His will that His light
enlighten our eyes, and that we maintain his kingship over us soon, in our
days.</p>

Scripture speaks in general terms - &quot;<i>When you approach a town&quot; </i>-
certainly this refers to every town and to every war. Be it an arbitrary war (<i>milchemet
reshut)</i>, be it an obligatory war (<i>milchemet chova</i>), you must first
talk peace - with the exception of Ammon and Moav, for the Torah specified:
&quot;<i>You shall never concern yourself with their welfare or benefit as long

if they, on their own volition, wish to make peace, we accept them. This
