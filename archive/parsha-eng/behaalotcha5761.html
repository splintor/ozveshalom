They sincerely declared &ldquo;<I>We recall the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for free&rdquo; &ndash;</I> and our sages explained homiletically &ldquo;free of the mitzvot&rdquo;. The meaning of this is that they would eat without giving <I>terumot u&rsquo;maaserot &ndash; </I>heave-offerings and tithes &ndash; (for this reason they also enumerated the cucumbers and the watermelons, etc., for all these are exempt from <I>maaser</I> outside the Land &ndash; even as rabbinical obligations &ndash; and compulsory within the Land only as a rabbinical injunction). Their declaration &ldquo;free of the mitzvot&rdquo; indicated stinginess towards the priest of God; therefore, they disliked the Land with its obligation. <B>The women of that generation, however, were righteous, and cherished charity &ndash; both the mitzvah of <I>challah</I> which is directed primarily at women and is obligatory in the Land, and all the other <I>terumot</I> and <I>maasrot</I>. </B>This is what our Sages had in mind when they said, &ldquo;In the merit of the righteous woman of that generation, our fathers were delivered from Egypt&rdquo; - meaning that because of their merit they [our fathers] went from a place of permission &ndash; <I>reshut &ndash; </I>to a place of obligation for which their [the women&rsquo;s&rsquo;] hearts yearned, and thus our Sages described the daughters of Tzlafchad as &lsquo;righteous women&rsquo; because they cherished charity, and therefore they asked &ldquo;<I>Give us a </I>holding<I>&rdquo;.&#9;&#9;&#9;</I><FONT SIZE=2>(Kli Yakar, Bemidbar 26, 64)</P>

The pivotal point of the story is that singular, pointed and powerful prayer of Moshe, our teacher:</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&ldquo;</FONT><I>O God, pray, heal her.&rdquo;</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</I></FONT>Moshe&rsquo;s brief entreaty is all the more striking against the background of his lengthy argument in the adjacent incident of <I>Kivrot HaTaava </I>(Burial-Places of the Craving): <I>&ldquo;Moshe said: Six hundred thousand on foot -- are there flocks and herds that may be slain for them . . . are there all the fish of the sea to be caught for them?&rdquo;</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to treat a few aspects of Moshe&rsquo;s prayer.</P>
<OL>
<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Relating to &ldquo;<I>pray heal her&rdquo;, </I>Rashi quotes the midrash in the Sifri:</LI></P></OL>
</OL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did not Moshe pray at length? It was in order that the Israelites not say: &ldquo;His sister is in distress, so he stands in extended prayer.&rdquo; And further on: &ldquo;Another explanation, lest Israel say &ldquo;For his sister he prays at length, but <B>for us</B> he does not prolong prayers.&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Midrash puts into the mouths of Israel two alternative complaints which offer contradictory explanations of the brevity of Moshe&rsquo;s prayer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reconsideration of the midrash reveals that the two &lsquo;contradictory&rsquo; accusations actually are quite compatible. They well suit the description of a grumbling and immature people heaping upon its leader scathing criticism from two opposing directions. The midrash relates negatively to the insufferable complaining of the people and to its exaggerated intervention in the private life of those who faithfully deal with the public&rsquo;s needs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The midrash&rsquo;s position emphasizes the need for finding legitimate and suitable balances between fair and proper criticism, and harmful criticism. Proper criticism is essential, it is part of the culture of checks and restraints on leadership. Criticism for its own sake, however, takes a heavy toll of public leadership and the public &ndash; and in our current situation, of the democratic system itself. Not only does it harm people engaged in public service and, occasionally, sap their strength; it is also liable to lead the public and the leadership to apathy and distrust of criticism in general.</P></DIR>

<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The Sifri emphasizes the supplicant&rsquo;s external motivation &ndash; public opinion &ndash; which influenced Moshe in formulation of his short prayer (&ldquo;lest Israel say&hellip;)</LI></P></OL>
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A completely different approach emerges from two incidents which occurred in Rabbi Eliezer&rsquo;s bet midrash <FONT SIZE=2>(Berachot 34a)</FONT>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Rabbis taught: A student went down to lead the service before Rabbi Eliezer, and he continued the service too long. Said his students to him: Our teacher, he is one who draws out the prayer. He replied: Does he draw it out more than Moshe our teacher, of whom it is written &ldquo;<I>And I fell before the Lord the forty days and the forty nights, etc.&rdquo;</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another story is told of a student who went down to lead the service before Rabbi Eliezer, and he severely abridged the service. His students said to him: How he briefly he prays! He replied: Is he more brief than Moshe our teacher, as is written: &ldquo;<I>O God, pray, heal her.&rdquo;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;It is interesting to compare the positions presented by the midrashim in the Sifri and in Berachot.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Moshe&rsquo;s prayer is the spontaneous prayer of an individual; in Rabbi Eliezer&rsquo;s bet midrash, the prayer is established public prayer. A student leads the service, the other students are dissatisfied, once because of the length, once because of the brevity. Rabbi Eliezer sanctions both, even though we are dealing with organized prayer which has clear rules. </P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>While the Sifri feels the need to rationalize the brevity of Moshe&rsquo;s impromptu appeal -- explaining it as a reaction to the pressure of public opinion -- Rabbi Eliezer sees Moshe&rsquo;s prayer as an ideal worthy of emulation, a paradigm with which he deflects the pressure of his community of students. </P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>It seems that Rabbi Eliezer stresses the personal emotional experience of the supplicant, preferring it to the accepted customs practiced in public prayer.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The <I>pshat &ndash; </I>the plain reading &ndash; of our parasha seems to be closer to the position taken by the berayta in Berachot. Moshe&rsquo;s brief prayer was accepted as a prayer of few words packed with personal emotional significance. The seemingly apologetic explanation offered by the Sifri may be seen as a homiletic exposition based upon the proximity of the prayer to the chapter on the <I>Kivrot HaTaava. </I>He relates the Israelite&rsquo;s grumbling here to the grumbling there.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moshe&rsquo;s passionate outburst can also be understood in the light of the special circumstances before us. Moshe, the most humble of men, is simultaneously hurt and rebellious. He is hurt by his sister&rsquo;s remarks, but he rushes to her assistance, upset at the sight of the terrible <I>tzaraat</I> which has afflicted her body.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>It seems that the basis for Moshe&rsquo;s short and wonderful prayer is not his anxiety for &ldquo;what will the people say&rdquo;, but the complete internal process which he is undergoing &ndash; both because of his sister&rsquo;s words and because of her appearance. This results in Moshe&rsquo;s poignant outcry:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moshe <B>cried out </B>to the Lord, saying: &ldquo;O God, pray heal her!&rdquo;</P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&rdquo;And you shall cleanse them&rdquo; </I>&ndash; The Holy Service Can Cause One to Stumble, and Requires Caution.</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;[The Torah] returns to warn regarding purity, for the nature of the Holy Service is that it can elevate man&rsquo;s heart in the ways of God, but one must be cautious lest he stumble on the obstacles of pride over others and desecration of the Holy Name, through even a minor infraction. So whoever is greater than his fellow, so is his inclination to commit transgressions uncommon to other men. Thus, proximity to holiness leads to <I>tum&rsquo;ah, </I>as in the words of the prophet Haggai (2:13): &ldquo;<I>If someone defiled by a corpse touches any of these, will it be defiled? . . .&rdquo;</I> And, as actually happened to Korach and his Levite followers<B>, whose greatness caused them to stumble</B>; therefore, the warning to maintain their state of purity after their service in the Tent of Appointme. <FONT SIZE=2>(Netziv, <U>Haamek Davar</U>, Bemidbar 8:15).</P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Awe and Humility</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was the argument of the convert in the chapter of &ldquo;Bameh Madlikin&rdquo; and the reason for Shammai&rsquo;s rejection of him. Shammai had reached the level of <I>yir&rsquo;ah --</I> of awe -- which is accompanied by <I>gevura &ndash; </I>courage, and by <I>kapdanut &ndash; </I>strictness -- which was the level of our father Yitzhak, o&rdquo;h, from whom Israel evolved. Therefore, he (Shammai) rebuffed converts, as related in the chapter Bameh Madlikin. . . . Hillel&rsquo;s humility brought them near, like Moshe our teacher o&rdquo;h, who was very humble, and therefore he brought close the <I>airev rav &ndash; </I>the non-Israelites who joined the Israelites in the Exodus . . . And so was our father Avraham o&rdquo;h humble, as is written in Tractate Berachot &ldquo;Woe [upon the passing of] this humble person, disciple of our father Avraham o&rdquo;h&rdquo;. Therefore he was the <B>father of converts</B>, as we learned in Bikkurim. Humility includes the appreciation of one&rsquo;s deficiency as compared with the greatness of The Holy One, Blessed Be He, and therefore has <B>no place for belittling the convert </B>who has come with his staff and pouch, for He who told oil to burn can tell vinegar to burn and it will burn, and he can put fire into vinegar, as with &ldquo;God, created within me a pure heart&rdquo;, <B>and creation is <I>ex nihilo.</P>

<B>About us</B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was founded in 1975 in order to present an alternative expression of religious Zionism. It is committed to promoting the ideals of tolerance, pluralism, and justice, concepts which have always been centrato Jewish tradition and law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was established by a group of awho were alarmed by the growing militance which they saw in most of the religious Zionist community. They were aware that religious fundamentalism, gaining hold throughout the region, mounted the greatest threat to possible coexistence, and believed that the only effective counter arguments would also need to stem from religious tradition. They were convinced that the established religious Zionist camp had become distanced from the values which had originally been its cornerstones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom shares a powerful attachment to the land of Israel and nevertheless views peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews have a religious obligation no less than a national one to support the pursuit of peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but an imperative.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s programs include both educational and protest activities. Seminars, lectures, workshops, conferences and weekend programs on a variety of topics are held for youth, students, educators and families, while protest activities focus on issues of human rights, co-existence between Jews and Arabs, and responses to issues of particular religious relevance. We publish 9,000 copies of a 4 page peace oriented commentary on the weekly Torah reading that is distributed to over 350 synagogues in Israel and is sent overseas via email.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s educational forums attract not only religious Israelis, but also secular people who are keen to deepen their Jewish knowledge and to hear an alternative religious standpoint on the subjects of peace and social issues. In many respects, therefore, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom fills the ideological vacuum which has been created and counteracts the stridency which is emerging in the right-wing community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committed to Jewish tradition and law, while supporting peace, equality and co-existence, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom is in a unique position to enter into a dialogue with both the secular left and the religious right.</P>
