class=SpellE>Meir</span> used to deliver discourses on Sabbath evenings. There
was a woman there in the habit of listening to him. Once the discourse lasted a
long time, and she waited until the exposition was concluded. She went home and
found that the candle had gone out. Her husband asked her: &quot;<span
class=GramE>Where</span> have you been?’ She answered: ‘I was sitting listening
to the voice of the preacher.&quot; <span class=GramE>Said he to her: &quot;I
swear I will not let you enter here until you go and spit in the face of the
preacher.&quot;</span> She stayed away one week, a second, and a third. <span
class=GramE>Said her neighbors to her: &quot;Are you still angry one with the
other?</span> Let us come with you to the discourse.&quot; As soon as R. <span
class=SpellE>Meir</span> saw them, he saw by means of the Holy Spirit [what had
happened], and said: &quot;Is there a woman among you clever at whispering a
charm over an eye?&quot; The woman's neighbors said to her: &quot;If you go and
spit in his eye you will release your husband [from his vow].&quot; When she
sat down before him she became afraid of him, and said to him: &quot;Rabbi, I
am not expert at whispering an invocation over an eye.&quot; <span class=GramE>Said
he to her: &quot;For all that, spit in my face seven times, and I will be
cured.&quot;</span> She did so, and he said to her: &quot;Go tell your husband:
You told me to do it once, and I spat seven times.&quot; <span class=GramE>Said
his disciples to him: &quot;Should people thus abuse the Torah?</span> Could
you not have told one of us to whisper an invocation for you?&quot; <span
class=GramE>Said he to them: &quot;Is it not good enough for R. <span
class=SpellE>Meir</span> to be like unto his Creator?&quot;</span>--for R.
Ishmael has taught: Great is peace, since even of the Great Name, written
though it be in sanctity, the Holy One, blessed be He, has said: &quot;Let it
be blotted out in water for the purpose of making peace between husband and
wife.&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Vayikra</span> <span

class=coversetext>Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: Should any
man's wife go astray and deal treacherously with him,</span> <span
class=coversetext>and a man lie with her carnally, but it was hidden from her
husband's eyes, but she was secluded [with the suspected adulterer] and there

class=coversetext>But a spirit of jealousy had come upon him and he became
jealous of his wife, and she was defiled, or, a spirit of jealousy had come
upon him and he was jealous of his wife, and she was not defiled.</span><span
class=psk> </span><span class=coversetext>Then the man shall bring his wife to
the priest and bring her offering for her, one tenth of an <span class=SpellE>ephah</span>
of barley flour. He shall neither pour oil over it nor put frankincense on it,
for it is a meal offering of jealousies, a meal offering of remembrance,
recalling iniquity.</span><span class=psk> </span><span class=coversetext>The priest
shall bring her near and present her before the Lord.</span><span class=psk> </span><span
class=coversetext>The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and
some earth from the Tabernacle floor, the priest shall take and put it into the
water.</span><span class=psk> </span><span class=coversetext>Then the priest
shall stand the woman up before the Lord and expose the [hair on the] head of
the woman; he shall place into her hands the remembrance meal offering, which
is a meal offering of jealousies, while the bitter curse bearing waters are in
the priest's hand.</span><span class=psk> </span><span class=coversetext>The priest
shall then place her under oath, and say to the woman, &quot;If no man has lain
with you and you have not gone astray to become defiled [to another] in place
of your husband, then [you will] be absolved through these bitter waters which
cause the curse.</span><span class=psk> </span><span class=coversetext>But as
for you, if you have gone astray [to another] instead of your husband and have
become defiled, and another man besides your husband has lain with you...&quot;</span><span

woman to drink, and the curse bearing waters shall enter her to become bitter.</span><span

offering of jealousies from the woman's hand, wave the meal offering before the
Lord, and bring it to the altar.</span><span class=psk> </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>This passage
raises many questions in the mind of today's reader. I will mention four of
them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>1) How can the
Torah, whose laws usually relate to precise fact, base an entire ritual system
on a feeling?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>2) Why the
outrageous inequality forming the basis of this ceremony, in which the women is
&quot;offered-up&quot; <span class=coversetext>[<i>The priest shall bring her
near</i></span> - <span class=SpellE><i>vehikriv</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>ota</span> <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span><span
class=SpellE>hakohen</span></i> - can also be read: and the priest shall offer
her up like a sacrifice] on the altar of her husband's feelings?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>3) How can
there be a ceremony based almost entirely on a miraculous divine intervention?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>4) Why does
God's explicit and holy Name play a role in such an early and illogical
ceremony?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>We may be
better suited to understand the <span class=SpellE>Sota</span> ceremony if we
adopt R. <span class=SpellE>Meir's</span> approach. R. <span class=SpellE>Meir</span>
takes it as a given that husbands are jealous regarding their wives. This
jealousy often results in harsh and problematic violence (even in our own day).
When individuals and couples have to contend with jealousy behind closed doors
and in the privacy of the bedroom they court tragedy; there is a danger of
injury. Following Scripture's lead, R. <span class=SpellE>Meir</span> offers an
alternative in which the conflict is removed from the private twilight zone
which invites danger to the public sphere - to Jerusalem - a place where other
people can offer support and help solve the problem. It is a place where the
priest becomes a party to the issue, a place where the suffocation of secrecy
can be relieved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>R. <span
class=SpellE>Meir</span> does not think the ceremony involves humiliation;
rather, it offers a positive and fruitful opportunity for the problem to be
addressed. The ceremony allows the marital situation to take a new direction
and escape the dead-end in which it is trapped. That new direction is one of
dialogue and perhaps even peaceful resolution. Rational dialogue can thrive - and
perhaps it can only thrive - when there is recognition of the irrational elements
that lie at the heart of the delicate fabric of all marital relationships. R. <span
class=SpellE>Meir</span> understands this. He is prepared to expose himself to
what others might count as humiliation - having one of his female students spit
in his eye seven times - in order to help her and her husband escape a trap of
jealousy and stormy emotions. That which the jealous husband sees as spittle
expressing his <b>anger and jealousy</b>, R. <span class=SpellE>Meir</span>
sees as <b>healing and kindness</b>, and as an instance of walking in the path
of God, Who is willing to have His Name erased in water in order to produce
peace between husband and wife. Perhaps this suggests that we should read and
explicate the text describing the ceremony along similar lines?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><i>They shall carry it on
their shoulders</i> - Man and State<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The relationship between the
political and social organization (the state) and the individual in the state
is the greatest and most encompassing and deep relationship vis-&agrave;-vis
the significant elements of human existence; it is as also possible to speak of
the relationship between state and society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The state, social organization,
and everything connected with them - from the struggle for positions of power
to politics in its broader sense as discussed by political thinkers from
ancient times until the present - the significance of this entire great
subject, with all its complications and <span class=GramE>complexity,</span> is
entirely instrumental.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The state is nothing but a tool
and means for the accomplishment of valuable goals involving the fulfillment of
basic human needs such as justice, education, health, culture, worship of God,
etc. No instrumental mechanism can achieve these goals. The state is important
only in that it allows the individual who is obliged to realize values to
realize them. The state itself should never be required or expected to realize
values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Similarly, regarding the holy
service of the Tabernacle we read, <span class=GramE><b><i>They</i></b></span><b><i>
shall carry it on their shoulders</i></b>. Man bears his obligations upon his
shoulders in two senses, and he must make great efforts to fulfill them. The
vessels and devices such as the &quot;wagons&quot; and the &quot;cattle&quot;
only carry the strips of cloth, screens, panels, stakes, sockets, bars,
columns, and so forth which are in no way part of the holy service. These
merely create the framework upon which the holy service depends. That service
can only take place when there are human beings who are prepared to trouble themselves
to freely take upon themselves the serious normative proviso of <b><i>They
shall carry it on their shoulders</i>.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>All over the world people
misunderstand the relationship between the instrumental and the valuable. Blindness
to this relationship is beginning to take hold upon us as well. It is moving us
towards a nationalistic-fascistic mood in the social, political, and national
realms, in which collective existence becomes an end in itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This matter finds symbolic
expression in the Tabernacle service: the Tabernacle's holiness is symbolically
represented by the vessels kept in the Tabernacle, such as the Ark, the table,
the menorah, and the two altars. These items were not moved in wagons or even
carried by draft-<span class=GramE>animals,</span> rather <i>They shall carry
it on their shoulders</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>That is the metaphor - what does
it represent? It says that instruments such as political sovereignty, sovereign
power, social mechanisms, etc. are incapable of realizing the values of human
existence. These values can only be accomplished by man himself; they are not
problems relating to the form of social existence, rather they are the problems
of man in society.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The last word in the priestly
blessing is <i>shalom</i> - peace. There is not enough space to say even a bit
about the significance and value of peace, peace upon which every blessing is
dependent...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It would seem that peace means
preventing the opposite of peace, that is to say: the prevention of war. And so
we read in the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>midrash</span></span> from <span
class=SpellE><i>Yalkut</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Shimoni</span></i>:
&quot;Great is peace, for peace is needed even in the hour of war, for it is
said: <i>If you draw near a town to do battle against it and you shall call to
it to make peace</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>
20:10)</span>.&quot; <span class=SpellE>Shalom's</span> deeper meaning,
however, is derived from the word <span class=SpellE><i>shlemut</i></span> - perfection/wholeness.
From this we can understand that shalom is the supreme virtue in connection with
man's status, condition, and perhaps even in connection with his essence. This
understanding may help us understand the Sages' dictum: &quot;Great is peace
for even the dead need peace, for it is said - <i>and you</i> [Abraham] <i>will
join your ancestors in peace</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bereishit</span> 15:15)</span>.&quot; People think that peace
means the cessation of a quarrel or of a war, but, as has been said above,
peace is more than the prevention of war; it is the most significant thing, it
is in fact the personification of God's power in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i>And God said to Moses, as

sin committed by humans</b> </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bamidbar</span> 5:6)</span>. Why was this <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>
written? Because it is written: <i>A person - when one sins, breaking-faith
against God... or by finding a lost object and denying it, or by swearing
falsely...To the one whose it is, he is to give it at the time of his being
proven guilty</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Vayikra</span>
5:21-24)</span> but regarding <b>stealing from the stranger</b> we do not find
the Torah commanding &quot;Speak to the Children of Israel: A man or woman who
does any sin committed by humans&quot; - therefore the Torah comes to teach us

</i>[conversion]&quot;- not only conceptually, but also <span class=SpellE>halakhically</span>;
the laws of conversion are derived from the story of Ruth the Moabite. This is
the reason that the Ruth scroll is read in Jewish congregations on Shavuot, the
occasion of the giving of the Torah, when those righteous converts who accepted
upon themselves the Torah and its commandments, became part of the Israelite
community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Connections may be found between
the Scroll of Ruth and the reading of <span class=SpellE>Nasso</span> on the
Shabbat following Shavuot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Among the many subjects included
in <span class=SpellE>sidrat</span> '<span class=SpellE>Nasso</span>' we find
the short chapter dealing with <span class=SpellE><i>asham</i></span><i> <span

guilt offering for wrongdoing against persons and then swearing falsely]. There
it says: <i>And if the man has no redeemer </i>[=kinsman] <i>to make
restitution of guilt payment to him... </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bamidbar</span> 5:8)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In this case, the Torah orders
the sinning thief who is repenting to transfer the <span class=SpellE><i>asham</i></span>
(i.e., the fifth added on the principle value of the stolen object) to the
priest. The question is asked, how it is possible that a Jew should have no
redeemer! Even if we were to say that he has no close relatives, there must be
in his tribe kinsmen and redeemers... from all the above we must conclude that
the phrase <i>has no redeemer </i>refers to none other than the convert, who,
upon conversion, severs all ties with his biological family, and now he is a Jew
without a redeemer. This <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> has generated much
thought and also <span class=SpellE>halakhah</span> on the subject of <span
