<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Yithro, Moshe's
father-in-law, wants to reunite Moshe with his family, his wife, Tsipporah, &quot;after
she had been sent away&quot; (a term, simply understood, related to divorce, as
is written &quot;and he shall send her away from his house&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>[Devarim 24.1]</span>), and the two sons, Gershom and
Eliezer, referred to as 'the sons of Tzipporah'. Moshe is happy to see Yithro,
but seems to exhibit no joy towards his wife/divorcee and his sons. His
father-in-law, seeing Moshe's heavy workload, advises him to delegate some of
his judicial authority to others, perhaps in the hope that he will be able to
devote some time to his family. There is no evidence, however, that Moshe's
lightened load leads to renewal of familial ties. After Moshe accepts Yithro's
recommendations, he sends him, too, off to his land <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(Shemot 14:27)</span>. It is not clear whether or not Tsipporah and her
sons accompanied Yithro. In any case, we are left with the impression that the
leader, devoted to his mission, remains separated from his wife, and distanced
from his sons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In order to
more fully understand the matter, we must go back to Parashat Shemot <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(3:18-26)</span>. Following Moshe's protracted refusal
to accept the appointment, there occurs the mysterious &quot;bridegroom of
blood&quot; incident. Moshe mounts his wife and sons on the donkey for the trip
back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>
- for God had told him &quot;all the persons who sought your life are dead&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid. 19)</span>. On the way, at the night
camp, he is imperiled by a supernatural force; he encounters the Lord who &quot;sought
to kill him&quot;.* By circumcising her son, Tsipporah saves Moshe from death. According
to one opinion in the Talmud, Moshe deserved punishment not because he had
neglected to circumcise his son, but because he gave &quot;priority to making
arrangements for camping&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Nedarim 31b)</span>,
which Rabbi Yitzchak Armaah explains, &quot;this term expresses attending to
love of his family, including the company of the wife and children&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Akeidat Yitzchak, Chapter 35)</span>. After the Lord's
attempt to kill him, Moshe understands that he must forgo the company of his
wife and sons. True, Tsipporah had repelled the threat on Moshe's life, saying
to him &quot;you are to me a bridegroom of blood&quot;; I saved you with the
blood of our son - the blood of the circumcision in place of your blood.
Through this you have again become my bridegroom. She pleads with him to return
to be hers - &quot;you are to me&quot;, but her cry remains unanswered once
Moshe considers himself dedicated wholly to his mission. There is nothing left
for conjugal and paternal relations. Tsipporah's hopes are dashed. The only
groom remaining for her is her son, the &quot;bridegroom of blood&quot;. In the
struggle between mission and family, the all-demanding mission prevails. Moshe
sends Tsipporah to her father's home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>At the giving
of the Torah at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sinai</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, Moshe's decision
receives approval. The Children of Israel, about to approach this encounter
with God, are commanded not to approach their wives: &quot;Ready yourselves for
three days. Do not go near a woman&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot
19:15)</span>. Moshe concludes that inasmuch as he is constantly in God's
presence, he is obligated to perpetual abstinence. This is one of the three
decisions that Moshe makes independently and the Almighty concurs <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shabbat 87a)</span>. Moshe's brush with Miriam at the
end of Parashat B'haalotecha <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bemidbar 1:15)</span>
raises the subject again. Most commentators identify &quot;the Cushite woman&quot;
that Moshe took and about whom Aharon and Miriam spoke, as Tsippora, Moshe's
ex-wife. God's excoriation of Aharon and Miriam ties in nicely with this
approach; Moshe's relation to God is an intimate one - &quot;mouth to mouth do
I speak with him&quot; - similar to that existing between husband and wife;
this closeness demands exclusivity and uniqueness. Therefore, says the Midrash
(quoted by Rashi) that the revelation to Miriam and Aharon was &quot;sudden&quot;,
while they themselves did indulge in <i>derech eretz </i>[the way of the land],
that is to say, did maintain conjugal relations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>All this came
to teach them that they are not permanently &quot;on call&quot; to receive
revelation; on the other hand, Moshe's separation from the woman was a result
of Moshe's need for intimate and constant closeness to God. This separation is
for selected individuals only: &quot;Go, say to them, Return you to your tents.
And you, stand here by me...&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Devarim
5:27-28)</span>. They returned to their tents, Moshe remained alone with the
Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It is
superfluous to note that in Christianity, abstinence became an ideal, and not
for individuals alone. Even in our own sources we see tension between those who
wish to devote themselves to the study of Torah and the desire to marry a
woman. This tension reaches its peak in the case of Ben-Azai who expounded that
whoever does not observe &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; is like a
murderer, even though he himself did not practice what he preached. Being
totally devoted to Torah study, he refrained from marriage, claiming that the
world can be run by others <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Yevamoth 65b)</span>.
But many are the stories about women who were neglected by their spouses who
devoted themselves to Torah. The iniquity perpetrated upon women, and the
punishment exacted from those whose Torah monopolized them to the point of
cutting off contact with their wives, are hinted at more than once <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(story of Rav Rahumi in Ketuboth 62b)</span>. But in
the case of Moshe, we do not detect any note of reservation from the insult and
hurt imposed upon Tsipporah, even though, according to our Sages, Tsipporah
expressed her concern for the wives of Eldad and Meidad who began &quot;to
prophecy in the camp&quot;, warning them that their end would be as hers,
separated from their husbands <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Sifri 99, and
Rashi on Bemidbar, ibid.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Similarly we
detect no note of demur at Moshe's shedding responsibility for his children.
According to the Midrash, this began yet when Moshe swore to Yithro. Whereas
the name Eliezer [God is my help] expresses Moshe's gratitude for his
deliverance: &quot;For the Lord of my father is my help and he rescued me from
Pharaoh's sword&quot;, the name &quot;Gershom&quot; expresses a kind of
apology: &quot;For I was a stranger in an alien land&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot 14:3)</span>. And perhaps these matters are
connected to that oath (appearing in the Midrash), which Moshe swore to Yithro,
that his first son would be dedicated to idolatry <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Mechilta
d'Rav Yishmael, Yithro, Masechta D'Amalek, 1)</span>. and therefore only
Tsipporah was able - through circumcision - to free Moshe of that oath. That
oath - hinted at in the phrase &quot;And Moshe agreed to dwell with the man <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot 2:21)</span> <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>- is repeated in the incident of the idol of
Micah &quot;And the Levite agreed to dwell with the man&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Judges 17:11)</span>, where the idol was made by &quot;Yehonatan,
son of Gershom, son of Menashe&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid.
18:30)</span>, dropping a hint that Menashe is none other than Moshe, because
the letter &quot;Nun&quot; is 'hung' - placed higher than the other letters - and
it is doubtful whether it is part of the name. All this comes to teach us that
Moshe's oath to his father-in-law continued to pursue his progeny. In any case,
Moshe's sons did not continue in their father's footsteps. The Midrash
identifies &quot;the lad&quot; who called upon Moshe to incarcerate Eldad and
Meidad who had prophesied in the camp <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bemidbar
11:27-27)</span> as Gershom <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tanhuma Buber, B'haalotecha
22)</span>, and Moshe's response- &quot;Are you jealous on my part&quot;
indicates that the lad's reaction was improper. The phenomenon of children not
following in their parents' ways is not uncommon in the Bible (for example, the
sons of Eli, who &quot;were scoundrels&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(I
Shmuel, 2:12)</span> and the sons of Shmuel &quot;who sought lucre, took bribes
and perverted justice&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid. 8:2-3)</span>).
One is lead to suspect - was this not perhaps the price that a prophet's family
had to pay for total devotion to his mission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>* An
alternative reading of the text has Moshe's firstborn son as the one doomed to
die. According to this interpretation, we have an associative continuum: <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> is God's
firstborn; Pharaoh refuses to send away the Jewish people. Therefore, measure
for measure, Pharaoh's firstborn is doomed to die (a hint anticipating the
Plague of the Firstborn); Moshe's oldest uncircumcised son is doomed to die,
but just as the blood sprinkled on the doorposts saved the Children of Israel

If&nbsp;&quot;Moshe hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law&quot;&nbsp;than&nbsp;certainly
&quot;he did it all as he had said&quot;!? - all that&nbsp;his father-in-law&nbsp;had
told him, these are the words of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Elazar HaModai says:
Moshe listened, and saw, and did all which God told him.&nbsp;<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Mekhilta, Yitro, Masechet Amalek, Parasha 2)</span>...
There is a difference between&nbsp;listening to a voice and hearing a voice.&nbsp;Shmiah&nbsp;b'kol&nbsp;indicates
reception of the words. Shmiah&nbsp;l'kol&nbsp;indicates that the listener is
taking the words to heart, carefully weighing with his intelligence. Therefore
it says &quot;He did it all as he had said.&quot;&nbsp;Had it been written
&quot;Vayishma&nbsp;b'kol&quot; - it would have been superfluous to add that
&quot;he did it all as he had said.&quot;&nbsp;But since it is written &quot;Vayishma&nbsp;l'kol&quot;
- meaning that he was contemplating his words, we cannot yet know that he
implemented his advice. At this point he is contemplating his words, but still
cannot implement them, because they have as yet not received Parashat Mishpatim
(set of laws), and Moshe did not want them to render judgment by their
reasoning and appraisal. Only afterwards, after he had taught them the laws,
did he do all that was said.</p>
