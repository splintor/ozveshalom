of warnings that deviation from the proper way of life will lead to the Land
vomiting out its inhabitants to exile. Tzei u'lemad (go out and learn) is a
popular expression among the Sages. It suggests that true and constructive
learning may involve the ability to leave one's place to some external,

experience may be found in Jewish life. The Passover Haggadah hints at this in
its midrashic explication of verses from the ceremony of the bringing of the
first fruits which mention the Exodus from Egypt (Devarim 26). The verse, He
brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and
honey, is not commented upon. Perhaps the message here is that escaping slavery
is the main thing, while entrance to the Land and sovereignty over it are a

in the Land while retaining a sense of exile from it is difficult and

earlier &quot;In a land not theirs: It does not say in the land of Egypt but in
a land that is not theirs.&quot; Four hundred years past from the day God made
the covenant of Brit bein Habetarim with Abraham until the realization of its
prediction. Apparently, the process of receiving sovereignty over the Land
requires a &quot;period of acclimation&quot; that includes acquaintance with
the surroundings and those working in them, internalization of modes of rule,

Shalom shares a deep attachment to the land of Israel and it no less views
peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews have both the
religious and the national obligation to support the pursuit of peace. It maintains
that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and just society, and that
co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but an imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Shalom's programs include both educational and protest activities. Seminars,
lectures, workshops, conferences and weekend programs are held for students,
educators and families, as well as joint seminars for Jews, Israeli Arabs and
Palestinians. Protest activities focus on issues of human rights, co-existence
between Jews and Arabs, and responses to issues of particular religious
relevance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Shalom fills an ideological vacuum in Israel's society. Committed both to
Jewish tradition and observance, and to the furthering of peace and
coexistence, the movement is in a unique position to engage in dialogue with
the secular left and the religious right, with Israeli Arabs and with
Palestinians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
