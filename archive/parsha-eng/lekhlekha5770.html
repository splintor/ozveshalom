memory, risked his life and broke Nimrod's idols and stood up against him, but
did not do so in the land of Canaan which was full of abominations and there
wasn't a single verdant tree [in Canaan] without idolatry beneath it and so too
with every tall mountain or high hill </span><span class=coversetext><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Avodah Zarah 45a)</span>. But we do not find that
Abraham shattered their idols - on the contrary, he prostrated himself before
the sons of Het and was submissive to them. However, the truth is that back in
Ur Kasdim they did not listen to him at all, and his rebukes were ineffective,
and he did not win a single soul as he did in the Land [of Israel], and no one
recognized the Lord there but he. That is why he risked his life [in Ur] to
separate them from idolatry, and if they killed him, what would it matter? However,
in the Land of Israel he called in the Lord's name and he became famous and
received tens of thousands of them and won many souls </span><span
class=coversetext><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(as RaMBaN writes on verses 2
and 8)</span>. That is why he was not permitted to risk his life by irritating
those who did not listen to him and convert: what would all those students who
depended on his teaching and instruction do [if he were killed]? You cannot say
he should have trusted in a miracle - that is not the way of the wise, since a
miracle might not occur to save him and he would just be submitting himself to
death. That is why he was not permitted [to risk his life] if that might be a
loss to the disciples, and he lived in the Land of Israel in order to publicize
his name, thus gathering many converts. He served God in tranquility and did
not need to quarrel with the wicked, rather, those who listened would listen
and those who did not did not, and so it [his going to the Land of Israel] was
for his<b> own good and benefit</b>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Abraham's story - and
with it, the story of the Jewish People - begins with the command, <i>Go forth
from your land and from your birthplace and from your father's house, to the
land that I will show you</i>. Why didn't Scripture locate the beginning of its
description of Jewish history in the Land of Israel, instead recounting the
three legs of Abraham's journey, which began in Ur Kasdim, continued to Haran,
and only then reached its completion in Canaan? Most of the commentators are
hard-put to explain this. They think that Abraham was adversely influenced by
the lands in which he grew up, &quot;Terah believed that his dwelling in Ur
Kasdim caused the problem&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Abarbanel)</span>.
Rashi explains the place-name <i>Haran</i>: &quot;Until Abraham arrived, God's
anger - <i>haron af</i> - was in the world.&quot; The choice of Canaan is also
left unexplained, and the commentators mostly treat the fact that no particular
land of destination was mentioned in the command Abraham received, rather the
verse speaks of <span class=coversetext><i>the land that I will show you</i></span>.
Rashi finds a similarity between the command to move to the Land of Israel and
the later command telling Abraham to go to Mount Moriah, Abarbanel says that
Canaan is advantaged by its unique air: &quot;It's air is good since it is a
mountainous and hilly land, so much so that its good climate caused the sons of
giants to live there.&quot;</p>

commentator, Philo of Alexandria, who lived in the first century of the Common
Era in the important Hellenistic center of Alexandria, Egypt and died about
twenty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, viewed Abraham's
journey from Ur Kasdim through Haran and ending in Canaan, as having an
important role in preparing Abraham for his life's mission. Each of the
stations of his journey had a positive affect on Abraham's development. The
very act of journeying from one country to another allows for inner
development. Philo says that a journey is an opportunity &quot;to investigate things
not previously known, something that brings the soul both pleasure and profit;
those who sit at home are to those who travel as the blind are to the sighted&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Philo, <i>On Abraham</i>, 65)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Philo describes Abraham's
wisdom as developing through three stages, each of which derives from a place
where he lived. Abraham's soul experienced an inner journey in each of the
places and his intellect developed to such a degree that God could communicate
with him directly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The first stage
involved Abraham's gaining a comprehensive education. This can happen in a
place of superior culture. In Abraham's case he received his education in Ur
Kasdim, which was the great power of his day. Abraham learned astronomy, which
was highly developed in Babylonia. Those who believed in the great power of
science had no doubts about its truth. Science granted them a strong foundation
for belief in the truth of that which they observed and the lawfulness deriving
from observation. Philo claims that the early name - &quot;Abram&quot; - refers
to his knowledge of astronomy: &quot;For Abram - <i>av ram</i> - means ‘Exalted
father'…the first name marks its bearer as an expert on the stars or an expert
on heavenly phenomena, who cultivates the opinions of the Kasdim as a father
cultivates his children&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid, 82)</span>.
The scientific view of the Kasdim saw astronomical observation as constituting
the acme of human wisdom: &quot;Everything in the world is controlled by powers
which are contained in numbers and relationships between numbers. They glorified
visible reality and neglected invisible and intellectual reality…they assumed
that the world is god, thus accepting heresy and identifying creation with the
Creator&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid, 69)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The second
developmental stage involved the ability to look inward into the soul of man. This
insight is also learned within the framework of human society. Deeper study
takes place in a narrower framework of scholars. The group of scholars lives in
a smaller place; it is less sure of itself and sees fit to ask questions and
raise doubts not only about the details of the phenomena being studied but also
about the general framework of knowledge within which it toils. Abraham's
encounter with the sages of Haran focused upon understanding man. &quot;'Haran'
in Greek means &quot;holes&quot; - a symbolic reference to the places where our
senses are located&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid, 72)</span>. That
is to say, we must attend to two different components in order to understand
man. The first is self-knowledge, &quot;Know thyself,&quot; while the second is
acquaintance with one's body's systems. The combination of these two allows us
to understand that man can use his mind and control the various parts of his
body and use his senses in a thoughtful way. Philo claims that understanding
the function of the human brain was for Abraham an important step towards
understanding that there is also something controlling the large natural
systems. Just as the brain controls the body there is a brain - God - who
controls the natural world. The move to Haran allowed Abraham to leave the
Kasdian astronomical view that is concerned with the material world and to
understand the need to undertake a spiritual quest for God. &quot;Abraham, who
had passed through this way and learned the entire sensual philosophy could
progress - leave Haran - and gain superior knowledge&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Philo, <i>On Dreams</i> 1)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The third stage of wisdom's
development took place with the entry to Canaan. For Philo, Canaan is not a
developed country enjoying special qualities, but rather a wasteland. Philo
describes Abraham's move from Haran to Canaan: &quot;The second migration is
again undertaken by the virtuous man under the influence of a sacred oracle,
but this is no longer one from one city to another, but it is to a desolate
country, in which he wandered about for a long time without being discontented
at his wandering and at his unsettled condition, which necessarily arose from
it&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>On Abraham</i> 85)</span>. Abraham
did not despair of his new place, as Philo believed would happen to most people
for whom such exile is worse than death. Rather, Abraham finds his purpose in
isolation and desolation: &quot;But this man alone appears to have behaved in
the contrary manner, thinking that life which was remote from the fellowship of
many companions the most pleasant of all. And this is naturally the case; for
those who seek and desire to find God, love that solitude which is dear to him&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid, 87)</span>. In the desolation Abraham
became aware of his nothingness compared to the world: &quot;To the extent that
a person grasps himself, his nothingness and the nothingness of all creatures,
he will be able to grasp his Creator&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>On
Dreams</i> 58)</span>. Only then could God reveal Himself to Abraham, bringing
him to ascend. &quot;Immediately after the sage left, it is said: <i>and God
showed Himself to Abraham</i>. From this it is clear that He had not revealed
Himself to him previously, when he behaved like a Kasdian, devoting his
thoughts to the host of stars&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>On
Abraham</i> 77)</span>. Only this combination of change of place with change of
outlook and the move to searching for that which is beyond the material allowed
God to reveal Himself to Abraham: &quot;But He, by reason of his love for
mankind, did not reject the soul which came to Him, but went forward to meet
it, and showed to it His own nature as far as it was possible that he who was
looking at it could see it. For which reason it is said, not that the wise man
saw God but that God appeared to the wise man; for it was impossible for anyone
to comprehend by his own unassisted power the true living God, unless He Himself
displayed and revealed Himself to him&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid
79-80)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>For Philo, wisdom
combines knowledge and understanding of the world with the ability to act; this
results in the possibility of connection with God. Abraham's physical journey
granted him the possibility of achieving wisdom and each of the stations along
the way prepared him to ascend to a new intellectual-spiritual level towards
the intimate encounter with God in the desolate land of Canaan. His association
with different people allowed Abraham to gain wisdom in both Ur Kasdim and
Haran, but the arrival in the wasteland allowed him to search for new and
personal paths in the search for God. Like RaMBaM, who lived a thousand years
later, Philo saw in rational-scientific wisdom a means towards thinking about
God. Abraham's intellectual ability allowed him to reach the supreme level of
human thought, which was a precondition for God's revelation to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Philo shows us a way to
develop wisdom that finds practical expression in life. He emphasizes the need
for broad education and self-knowledge of one's strengths and limitations as
the foundations for the development of independent thought. The first two steps
prepare one for entering the desolation where one can raise the deepest
questions. The wasteland, described as an empty place where other people have
never operated, is where the educated person can make his stand and decide to
seek out the challenges which will grant meaning to his life. And there are
many wastelands in our vicinity.</p>

Rosenson, who heads Michlelet Efrata. The article, which is titled, &quot;Gedaliah,
Rachel, Rabin - Religious-Zionist Meditations on Days of Commemoration,&quot;
reviews different ways the Religious-Zionist community has dealt with the Rabin
murder over the years, beginning with the attempt to &quot;revive&quot; Tzom
Gedaliah by pointing to elements shared by the political assassination
mentioned in Scripture with the Rabin murder and concluding with the attempt to
connect Rabin's murder with the eleventh of Heshvan, the day which commemorates
the death of our mother Rachel. Prof. Rosenson quotes a passage from an article
which appeared a year ago in <i>Makor Rishon</i> concerning &quot;the
reinvesting of historical dates with irrelevant significance as an important
mechanism for dealing with memory formation and alternative membership in an over-heated
and multi-sectoral society.&quot; As Yohai Ben Gedaliah wrote in his article, &quot;Without

Rachel offers a more recent and therefore less pleasant example. I remember
that when I was a child this day was not celebrated in the government-religious

mostly attended by Haredim. For various and understandable reasons, the
mourning for Rachel was reawakened by the national-religious community in
reaction to Rabin's murder and the unease felt in its wake. It was easy to flee
from self-scrutiny - and especially from the campaign of incitement against the
kippa-wearing public - to the warm and consoling embrace of our mother Rachel. While
the character of the memorial day for Rabin had not yet crystallize for the

which the murder and the right to mourn it has been monopolized by people who
