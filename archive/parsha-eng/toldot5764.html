abyss. They are opposites of each other. Oil and water. A wild-man with

books. One is red, sporting a hairy mantle (25:25). The other - perhaps
black-haired and pale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bridging, but not self-compromising. The complicated process of rivalry,
clashes, separation, and kissing. A possible cyclical dance of love and hate. It
is difficult to perceive the original roots of enmity in this fiendish dance. Israel
here and Edom there, Jacob and Esau, a breach between worlds, across thousands
of years, an ocean between them. Jacob and Esau are brothers. One upon the heel
of the other. They both emerged from the same womb as twins. <i>Tumim</i> [the
Torah spells Hebrew word for twins missing the letter alef] to let you know
that something is defective in this twinning. Despite the genetic similarity,
despite the shared identity at the moment of birth - they are different. Brothers,

strata hide below the surface (I am indebted to my son Or, who brought the
following ideas to light in our joint study). The brother's jealousy rests upon
a split between the parents. The depth of the rift spans the generations. Isaac
and Rebekah are not joined hand-to-hand. The differences between them are
emphasized in all of the descriptions of their intimacy/distance. The first
encounter between the girl taken from the house of her father - his uncle, by
their servant Eliezer, and the master's son is described as a passive
relationship: <i>And she said to the servant, </i>&quot;<i>who is that man
walking in the field toward us?</i>&quot;<i> And the servant said, </i>&quot;<i>That
is my master.</i>&quot;<i> So she took the veil and covered herself</i>. It
seems that this veil brought from Padan Aram would always separate between
Isaac and his wife. When the local people asked him about his wife, he said, &quot;She
is my sister&quot; (26:7). It appears that the word &quot;love&quot;, <i>Isaac
then took her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebekah as his
wife. Isaac </i></span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i><span

with his consolation over his mother's death, brings to light how cold Isaac's
relationship with Rebekah was, from the very start. The tension between passive
Isaac and active Rebekah projects upon the relations between Jacob and Esau. <i>Isaac

layered with opportunities for friction. Padded with disagreements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

relationship is bound-up in manacles of norms, prejudices, customs and
cultures, which strengthen and reinforce polarization. A reversal is necessary
to change a hater to a lover. Reversal rather than connection. It is necessary
to tear away the veils and partitions in order to create cooperative living

the boys' mother, prompts the recognition that the differences are external. She
enlightens Isaac's darkened eyes, and brutally makes it clear to him that that
there is no guarantee that his senses will discover the truth. Externalities
can confuse. Reliance on familiar indicators is insufficient for the probing of
hearts. When he discovered that she was right, he became fearful. <i>Isaac was
seized with very violent trembling</i> (27: 33). He was suddenly struck by the
comprehension of how poorly he knew his sons. He was shrouded by a strong
awareness of missed opportunities. The accepted order and hierarchies melted
away. Who received the proper blessing? Who should be granted the status of the
first-born? Who is the strange &quot;other&quot;, and who the near, the &quot;similar&quot;?
<i>The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau</i>. The
external signs, the mane of hair, the voice, smell, and clothing no longer mark
the &quot;right&quot; side, the &quot;just&quot; party to the conflict. The
simple world, divided between sides, has blurred. Suddenly, the next required
stage becomes clear. Distancing. Weakening the factors supporting conflict. Preparation
for the needed metamorphosis. Readiness for reversal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

conflict cannot be resolved in the present way. Its deeper strata live and
exert their influence. The dialogue taking place between the sons via their
parents ends in failure. Enmity increases, walls are raised higher. <i>Now Esau
harbored a grudge against Jacob...and Esau said to himself, </i>&quot;<i>Let

disagreement has no forced, external, solution. Separation is required during
the interim period. Jacob flees, distances himself from the threat. He goes to
his mother's family, and Esau goes to his father's. Each to his tribe. <i>Two
nations apart while still in your body</i>. Distance from the basic irritants
will contribute to the process. They will aid the next stage. They clear space
for the genuine inner work. For the process of transformation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it we may understand the parallel process that both brothers passed through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Jacob's
departure, his maturation, his work and his marriages, together with his
fatherhood, allowed him to contend with the devils inside him. To wrestle with
his inner demons. <i>Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until
the break of dawn</i>. Wrestling that changed him physically and spiritually. An
essential change. From <i>Okev </i>(one-who-comes-next) to <i>Sara-El</i>
(One-who-strives-with-the-divine&quot;). From a youth pulled along after his
brother to a striving, independent personality. <i>Said he, </i>&quot;<i>Your name
shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have strived with beings divine
and human, and have prevailed.</i>&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

victory over his ghosts that visited him in the dead of night, the crossing of
his private Yabok, prepared him to confront his prejudices, to contend with the
different, the other, with his brother Esau. It changed him into a new person,
better prepared - Israel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

flight, exile, hard work, and self-confrontation brought Jacob to the place
where he could meet Esau, hug him, and kiss him. That connection is an
expression of mutual reconciliation. Of compromise. Of the dissipation of
tensions. It is a good-by hug. A peaceful parting. This traveled to Seir, the
other to Sukkot. They each became reconciled with the other's existence. Distant
neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the commandment (<i>But if you make for Me an altar of stones, do not build it
out of hewn stones; for by wielding your sword upon them you have profaned them</i>
- Shemot 20:22) is that iron is a sword (<i>herev</i>) and it destroys (<i>mahriv</i>)
the world and so it is named. Esau, <i>who is hated by the Lord</i> (Malachi
1:3) inherited the sword, for he [Jacob] said to him, <i>by your sword shall
you live </i>(Bereishit 27:40), and the sword is his power in heaven and on
earth, for in Mars and the bloody constellations the sword shall prevail, and
in them its valor shall be seen. Therefore, it will not be brought to the house
of the Lord. That is the reason why scripture explicitly mentions <i>do not
build it out of hewn stones</i>, since by wielding any iron [implement] to make
them so, you wielded over them your murderous sword which kills many, and have
profaned it. That is why there was no iron in the Mishkan; although it would
have been preferable to make its stakes out of iron, they were made of copper. Similarly,
none of the vessels of the Temple were made of iron, except for the knives,
since the actual slaughter is not considered part of worship, and scripture
only prohibited building with stones hewn with iron tools, because it referred
to <i>wielding your sword upon them</i>, and included in this is do not wield
an iron tool over them (Devarim 27:5)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an out-doors man who hunts in the wilderness and in ruined and desolate places,
it was appropriate for him to receive the blessing of the sword, and the planet
Mars which is associated with the spillers of blood has great power over
destruction and the sword, so Esau's seed inherited the sword. His s<i>ar</i>
[patron angel] is the killing power with whom the sword is associated. For this
reason the Torah prohibited the sword and iron in the Mishkan and Temple; in
regard to the Mishkan, it is written, <i>gold, and silver, and copper</i>
(Shemot 25) and there was no iron there what-so-ever. In regard to the Temple,
it is written <i>no hammer or ax or iron tool was heard in the house while it
was being built</i> (I Kings, 6), since iron is for swords and it destroys the
world, while the Temple preserves the world. <i>And you shall serve your
brother </i>- when Jacob is worthy. <i>But when you grow restive</i> - when he
is not worthy - <i>you shall break his yoke from your neck</i>. And that is the
intention of Onkelos when he translated it, &quot;When his children transgress
