man who works his land. <i>Blessed are you when you come</i> refers to the man
who works his land and who, in the morning, goes to his field and vineyard and
to inspect his flock and who returns in the evening. Sometimes the women are
also in the fields and the children and all their possessions are alone at home
all day long and He promised them that when they return home they will find
everything is well and that nothing bad had happened. This also includes the
times that they go to see God's countenance in Shiloh or Jerusalem, that God
promised them that<i> no man will covet your land</i>. It also applies to the
days of Hezekiah when they would leave their homes and go to yeshivot to learn,
that when they would return to their homes they would be blessed. Since this
blessing is vital and beloved, it was mentioned before the blessing of
departure. <span class=coversetext><i>And you shall be blessed when you depart</i>
says that when you leave your home to go out to the field you will be blessed,
that no member of the household will be ill and that nothing else bad will
occur, so that you will not be worried while out of the house. Similarly, when
you go on pilgrimage, all that is left at home will be blessed and without
grief. With this the first section is completed. It was fulfilled from the days
of Joshua until those of King Saul; during that period divine punishments were
infrequent. Those punishments are stipulated in the curses, they consist of
many items, and each item was fulfilled at a known time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This is a kind of
miniature Passover Haggadah; in fact, these verses were incorporated into the
Haggadah and serve as one of its most basic and ancient sections, as we read in
Mishnah Pesahim 10:4: &quot;He begins with derogation and ends with praise, and
explicates from <i>Arami oved avi</i> until he completes the entire
passage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The Haggadah's early
editors took pains to carry out the Mishnah's instructions to
&quot;explicate&quot; these verses, and their reading of the opening verse
strays far from the plain meaning: &quot;Go and learn: What did Laban the
Aramean want to do to our Father Jacob? Pharaoh only decreed [to kill] the
males, while Laban wanted to uproot everything, for it is said, <i>Arami oved
avi, etc.</i>&quot; According to this interpretation (which is already found in
Targum Onkelos and in Rashi's commentary on the verse), the word
&quot;Aramean&quot; is the subject of the sentence, and it refers to Laban the
Aramean (as he is called several times in the Torah). The word <i>oved</i> is
understood as a verb, meaning &quot;sought to destroy,&quot; and <i>avi</i> [my
father] is the object of the sentence - it refers to Jacob, who was the object
of his father-in-law's hatred. Thus the verse recounts the first chapter in the
terrible history of anti-Semitism; it constitutes a kind of archetype for the
persecution that has threatened Jewish survival in every generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Thanks to the charm and
beauty of the Haggadah and the special festive nature of its recitation, this
drasha has a stronger hold upon us than does the plain meaning of the verse
itself. However, I believe that in this case the plain meaning of the verse is
much more fascinating and instructive than that of its drasha. According to the
plain reading, the subject of the sentence is <i>avi </i>[my father] and the
words <i>Arami oved</i> are the predicate. Who is the &quot;father&quot; who is
here called an &quot;Aramean&quot;? It seems that this is a reference to the
patriarchs <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ShaDaL, R. Yithak Reggio)</span>,
or, more specifically, Abraham, who was exiled from Aram Naharaim <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(RaShBaM)</span>, or, according to majority opinion,
Jacob, who fled to Aram and stayed with Laban <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibn
Ezra, Sforno, Hizkuni)</span>. These exegetes read the word <i>oved</i> as an
intransitive verb. Some say it means &quot;was impoverished, without
money&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibn Ezra, Hizkuni)</span>, while
the majority render it as &quot;wandering&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(RaShBaM,
Sforno, Reggio, ShADaL)</span>. Thus, according to the majority of exegetes,
the verse means: <i>My father Jacob was a wandering Aramean</i>. This
interpretation is philologically reasonable and it certainly fits the context
of <i>Mikra Bikurim</i>. What of the question it naturally raises, i.e., why
does the Torah refer to one of the Patriarchs as an &quot;Aramean&quot;? That
was already addressed by Ibn Ezra, the originator of this line of
interpretation: &quot; Let it not be asked how [Jacob] could be called an Aramean,
since similarly an Israelite is called an Ishmaelite, for that is
written.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Such things do happen,
and there is nothing to be surprised about. Ibn Ezra finds an obscure figure in
the Bible, &quot;Yeter&quot; or &quot;Yitra,&quot; father of Amsa. Yeter was an
Israelite but he is called an Ishmaelite <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(see II
Samuel 17:25; I Chronicles 2:17)</span>. From this we learn that proper Jews
can sometimes be referred to by inappropriate appellations such as
&quot;Ishmaelite&quot; or &quot;Aramean.&quot; Even so, the opening verse of <i>Mikra
Bikurim</i> remains surprising. Why does the Torah refer to the Patriarchs in
this fashion? &quot;Aram&quot; and &quot;Aramean&quot; bear clearly negative
connotations; they are used in the Torah to describe rivals and enemies - Laban
the Aramean and Balaam ben Beor who came from <i>Petor Aram Naharaim to curse
you</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Devarim 23:5)</span>. But there is
something to this usage. This unusual appellation and its strange presence in
this context offers a key for understanding the deeper meaning of <i>Mikra Bikurim</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>According to RaMBaM, the
commandment of <i>Mikra Bikurim</i> is meant to break our pride as landowners
precisely at the moment that land produces its first fruits; this restrains our
arrogance as lords of the land when we feel satisfied with ourselves, our
wealth, and our control over the natural environment and its resources. <i>Mikra
Bikurim</i> helps us develop humility and gratitude towards the Creator, since
&quot;It is part of the service of God that a person remembers his times of
trouble and his matters of grief when God grants him bounty&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> 3:39)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>If we further develop
this notion - which is held in common and in a variety of versions by many of
Israel's sages who wanted to understand the rationale of the commandment of the
first fruits - we can say that the utterance in question - <i>Arami oved avi</i>
- gives the measure of the degree of humility required of an Israelite of that
class. In the harvest festival a man leaves his permanent home, full of bounty,
and enters the simple and rickety sukkah. This act is also a commemoration of
the historical past, a journey out from the Land flowing with milk and honey in
return to the wilderness. <i>Mikra Bikurim</i> similarly shatters our
egocentrism and reminds us of the historical past; it constitutes a symbolic encounter
with the ancient history of the People Israel, stretching back far before the
generation of the wilderness. It is a journey to the time when the people
descended to Egypt and later left it, and even earlier - to the time when we
were not yet called &quot;Israel.&quot; It was Jacob, the first to known as
&quot;Israel,&quot; who is here given the name of the stranger and enemy, the
&quot;Aramean.&quot; The bringing of the first fruits demands a double humility,
humility both on the personal and national planes. One must mentally return to
the days when one was an Aramean, to the days of one's wandering. Not only did one
lack a hereditary parcel of land - one had yet to even form a people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This is doubtlessly an
important and psychologically refreshing exercise; it shatters both pride and
the radically dichotomous view that sees Israel's relationship with the outer
world in terms of unavoidable enmity. It might be mentioned that the Haggadah's
interpretation of <i>Arami oved avi</i> strengthens this dichotomy; it presents
reality in sharp terms of &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;: Laban the
Aramean wanted to do away with Jacob because in each and every generation
&quot;they stand upon us to destroy us.&quot; The plain meaning of the verse
squarely contradicts this approach. We might say with greater precision that
the plain reading engages the drasha in fruitful dialectic dialogue: not only
does it not represent the struggle with the other as an eternal way of life, it
even alludes to empathy with the other. The Aramean, the other, is not
necessarily an enemy. If I poke around carefully in my historical memory, I
will discover that I am also the descendent of a wandering Aramean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>In order to reach a
balanced position on the issue of the relations between Israel and the nations, we must combine both of the contradictory interpretations given to
our verse. If we ignore the opinion of the compilers of the Haggadah - that in
each and every generation the People Israel faces bitter enemies - we will
certainly fail to understand our early and more recent history. However, if we
reject the interpretation which plays down the dichotomy and the gap between
Judaism and the world around it, we shall sin even more grievously: we will sin
against the future of the People Israel and against the possibility of
realizing our religious and national purpose in peace for the good of all mankind
and as a member in the family of nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
text-autospace:none;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The idea of Israel's

that drasha, inheritance of the land does not depend upon the temple, but
rather upon our relationship with God. The drasha on Vayikra contradicts that
found in Ketuvot 110b on the same verse: &quot;One should always dwell in the Land of Israel, even in a town that is mostly [populated by] idolaters; and one should not
live outside the Land even in a town [populated] mostly by Israelites. For
everyone who dwells in the Land of Israel is like someone who has a God, while
all those who live outside the Land are like someone who has no God, for it is
said: <i>To give you the Land of Canaan, to be God for you</i>. According to
Ketuvot, those who live outside the Land may lose their connection with God,
while according to our drasha - and the plain meaning of the verse - it is the
connection with God that makes life in the Land possible.</span></p>
