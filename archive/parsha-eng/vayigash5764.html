relations between Joseph and his brothers to its dramatic climax. The course of
events was set into motion when the fact that <i>Israel loved Joseph most of
all his sons</i>, and the tangible expressions of his love, created a situation
in which Joseph's brothers so hated him that <i>they could not speak a word of
peace to him</i> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

and certainly not the first case of hatred that stems from parental love,
resulting in thirst for revenge and death threats. Here hatred expressed by a
lack of communication leads to especially harsh consequences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>It is interesting that after years of adventures
and maturation, after Judah makes his brilliant speech to Joseph, the ruling
viceroy of Egypt, the first reaction to Joseph's self-disclosure to his
brothers is actually a bit disappointing. It is basically a return to the old
pattern - <i>his brothers could not answer him</i> </span><span

"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. The moment of Joseph's
disclosure is the great and long-awaited catharsis, and it is greeted with...silence.
Scripture itself is aware of the awkwardness of the moment, and steps in to
fill the yawning void. Scripture brings up one of the most common explanations
for the lack of communication - <i>for they panicked</i>. Earlier, hatred
served as an excuse for the brothers' lack of speech, but now it is panic. Panic,
according to Hizkuni, at what Joseph would do to them, or, as Rashi explains,
out of shame, or perhaps as the NeTziv suggests, shock at the realization of
the dreams of Joseph's youth (ambitions which they themselves were unable to
achieve). No matter what the interpretation, the bottom line remains the same;
an instinctive reaction - no talking with Joseph. They have <i>forgotten </i>how
to talk. The abstention from communication throughout the relationship created
a pattern that could not be easily changed, certainly not in a moment of crisis
and trepidation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

process is so crucial that the content of the communication is not related to
us, but rather the bare fact that it took place. Perhaps this can serve as a
basis for psychologists to investigate how the ice finally breaks and how the
atmosphere changes, and what occurred at the exact moment when the viceroy's
great hall, draped in silence, embraced intimate words shared among brothers
who had never before spoken to each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>I would like to draw attention to another point,
which I believe is of great importance for our topic. As I have mentioned, part
of the lack of communication derived from the pattern that had been tacitly
established during the youth of Jacob's children. Accordingly, the silence
between Joseph and his brothers may have been successfully broken because of
unconscious connections with an earlier process in the family's history. Father
Jacob's relationship with his brother was also difficult. A few weeks ago we
read about the dramatic meeting between Jacob and Esau. In contrast to the
present encounter, that meeting was accompanied by much tense thought and
preparation. However, in both cases the elements of fear and uncertainty played
important roles. Jacob tried to approach his brother, but was not sure what
fate awaited him. Yet, it was <i>Esau</i> who released a sigh of relief. What
did he do? <i>Esau ran to greet him. He embraced him and, falling on his neck,
he kissed him; and they wept</i> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Bereishit
33: 4)</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. This was no doubt a meaningful moment in Jacob's
life. Could it be that these small gestures of affection were etched in Jacob's
mind and passed on to his sons for an inheritance as gestures that signal the
possibility of escape from silence?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>I believe that the encounter did leave its mark on
the family. Perhaps that was why Joseph, seeing that he could not talk with his
brothers, chose to repeat precisely those same emotionally charged actions. <i>He
embraced his brother Benjamin around the neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on
his neck. He kissed all his brothers and wept upon them </i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'>(45: 14-15)</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. Joseph reenacted a moment that
was intuitively identified with the ability to remove inhibitions and breathe
freely. <i>Only then were his brothers able to talk to him</i>. Joseph
wordlessly reminded his brothers that enmity and lack of dialogue, even
readiness to murder, do not have to last forever. The repetition of exactly
those same actions - falling on each other's necks, kissing and weeping - served
as a reminder that the fear and remoteness that are characteristic of the
encounter with a brother-turned-enemy were not the only memories they inherited
from their father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>We must remember that these steps only opened the
dialogue. They did not melt away all of the suspicions and fears associated
with the conflict between Jacob and Esau (see, for instance, the midrashim
related to the dots traditionally placed above the word <i>vayeshakuhu</i> ),
nor were they able to do so in the case of Joseph and his brothers (as we see
following Jacob's death). The entire family probably continued to suffer from
the tension that the conflict between Jacob and Esau left in its wake, casting
its shadow upon their ability to converse with each other. It seems to me that
that is exactly why the moment of Jacob and Esau's reconciliation was so
powerfully fixed in the family's memory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Now, at his life's close and after countless
hardships, Jacob understands that he must bury the ancient conflict carried in
his heart in order to let faith in the possibility of reconciliation enter into
his home. He cannot speak of the importance of dialogue between his sons before
settling his own past disagreement. Jacob now repeats the expression of
reconciliation first spoken by his brother Esau: <b><i>Enough!</i></b><i> My
son Joseph is still alive! </i>I no longer look askance at my brother, checking
to see what he has and what I lack. Now I bless God for what I do have and
value it all the more. This may also explain why Jacob crossed his hands when
blessing Ephraim and Manasseh. It is as if he were showing that he no longer
cares for the rules of primogenitor; he is satisfied with the blessing reserved
for each son, whomever he might be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Jacob understands that situations that block
dialogue are not created by a single factor alone. Indeed, circumstances
influence the situation that then builds up like a snowball. Yet another
insight is at work here, first in Joseph, and later in his father. A break in
communication in one area, even if it appears quite distant from other areas of
life, can contribute significantly to feelings of alienation and troubled
patterns of communication. The relationship between Joseph and his brothers is
not cut off from the relationship between Jacob and Esau. Now Jacob goes forth
with all of his sons and daughters, his livestock and possessions. This is the
second time he leaves with such a massive entourage. This time it is laden down
not only with the years of conflict between himself and his brother; it is also
burdened with the effects of that conflict on his family. In order to reach
that future meeting between his children, he must relate to his past
relationships and encounters as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

prophecy of future events: The reunification of Judah and Joseph, and the
political and spiritual rehabilitation of the Jewish people after it had been
divided into two separate nations. The prophecy was not fulfilled. This
requires us to consider and discuss the meaning of prophecies regarding the
future, which seem to predict what will happen. Ezekiel says his piece after
Judah and the Ten Tribes were already exiled... Hosea and Amos, who prophesized
the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, agree with the prediction that Israel
shall return. It was never fulfilled. In this case, it is impossible to accept
the midrashic view of unfulfilled prophecies - i.e., that they will come to
pass in the end of days. The ten tribes, including Joseph's children, were
wiped off the face of the earth, apparently not in the physical sense but
rather in the spiritual and fundamental sense: they were completely assimilated
into the peoples among whom they had been exiled, leaving no trace in
historical reality. Already in the Talmudic period, Rabbi Akiva who knew the
prophetic traditions as well as we do, could state: &quot;The Ten Tribes will
never return.&quot; He knew that they are lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that they will materialize... The Tosafot says: &quot;A prophet only
prophesizes what would be proper to happen, if no sin occurs.&quot; Throughout
the generations, false prophets have preached faith in the certainty of unconditional
