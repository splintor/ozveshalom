symbolic acts, and prophecies of punishment and comfort - to awaken in <st1:place

ancestor Reuben, the eldest son who felt responsible for the welfare of his
young brother - the eldest son who felt the pain and anguish of his father and
sought to return his beloved son to him - even if it threatened his own status.

as of parent and child is well known and wide spread, and it seems to me that
this is the way we generally perceived our relationship with the Holy One
Blessed be He, both as individuals and as a people. <span class=GramE>A
relationship where one side - God - is strong and dominant - the all-powerful
and sole responsible source of decisions, and the other side - us - who are
dependant on Him hoping, anticipating and wishing for His mercy and pardon.</span>
Relations like these are in a way simple and straightforward compared to those
between a married <span class=GramE>couple</span>, which are entirely
different. There the responsibility for preserving and nurturing the relationship
devolves on both partners. Where one side becomes distant it is up to the other
to make the first step to draw near to the partner reminding them of the love
and mutual obligations (between them) and to try to repair the damage. This
obviously demands greater maturity and discipline, but the subsequent
satisfaction is greater and the connection between the parties is more
complete. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

times when - and in our generations they have been frequent and painful - in
which God hides His presence from us and apparently from the covenant between
us. Situations like these are a challenge for us: they invite us to take
responsibility for the continuation of the covenant. It devolves upon us to
take the step towards the Holy One Blessed Be He and to remind him of &quot;the
covenant and the love and the oath&quot; and to demand that He shines His face
on us and on the world anew. Judaism, as Emanuel <span class=SpellE>Levinas</span>
taught us, is &quot;a religion for mature people.&quot; A substantial part of
what maturity means is the ability to understand what is demanded of us. Instead
of relying on: &quot;there is no one else to lean on except our father in
Heaven,&quot; we are obliged to measure ourselves by a different rule - far
more demanding and <span class=SpellE>difficult.We</span> must take upon
ourselves to be active partners in building a world whose foundation is a
covenant, participation and love. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
