direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Scripture
portrays our Father Abraham as someone who is not very good at forming strong
social ties. Abraham does not hesitate from cutting himself off from his land,
his birthplace, and his father's house in order to trek to a distant and
unfamiliar land. He even neglected his wife when they neared Egypt, telling her
to present herself as his sister to the Egyptians. Even if his calculations
were correct, they were still cold and utilitarian, and he gave them precedence
over his feelings towards his spouse. When controversy arose between his
shepherds and those of his nephew Lot, Abraham suggested to him that they
separate immediately: <i>if you take to the left, I will take to the right; and
if you take to the right, I will take to the left</i>. Abraham did not seek compromise
between the two sides, and even though he was dealing with his own blood
relative - apparently the only such relative to accompany him on his travels
from the distant east - Abraham preferred to disengage from him. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This line of behavior is further exemplified
by Abraham's treatment of Hagar, Ishmael, and of course - Isaac, whom he was
prepared to offer up as a burnt offering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
Sages added depth to <span class=GramE>Abraham' s</span> story by describing
the background to this behavior. According to <span class=SpellE>Midrash</span>
<span class=SpellE>Rabbah</span>, already in his youth Abraham displayed a lack
of concern for social norms and conventions. In an especially well known
episode found in <span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span> <span class=SpellE>Rabbah</span>
(section 38, pp. 361-4 in the Theodore-<span class=SpellE>Albeck</span>
edition), Abraham smashes his <span class=GramE>father' s</span> idols, thereby
challenging not only his immediate circle but even King Nimrod himself. The <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>midrash</span></span> describes how <span
class=SpellE>Terah</span> repeatedly left Abraham alone in charge of his idol
shop. Abraham took a hammer and smashed the idols, leaving the hammer in the hand
of the largest of them. When his father returned, he asked: &quot;Who did this
to them?&quot; Abraham answered: &quot;A woman came bringing a plate of fine
flour, asking me to offer it up to them. I offered it before them, and one of
them <span class=SpellE>said'I</span> shall eat <span class=GramE>first' <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>and</span> another one <span class=SpellE>said'I</span>
shall eat first.' <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The biggest of them
stood up and took a hammer and smashed them.&quot; <span class=SpellE>Terah</span>
said: &quot;Why are you fooling with me as if they know [what is happening].&quot;
Abraham said to him; &quot;Will your ears not hear what your own mouth says?!&quot;
<span class=SpellE>Terah</span> took him and handed him over to Nimrod. Nimrod
and Abraham engaged in a pointed theological debate, at the end of which
Abraham was cast into the fiery furnace and saved by God. I believe that the
Archimedean point in this <span class=SpellE>midrashic</span> story occurs when
<span class=GramE>Abraham' s</span> father <span class=SpellE>Terah</span>
hands him over to Nimrod. Not only did the father fail to protect his son - he actually
took the initiative and handed him over to the cruel Nimrod, who, true to
character, did not flinch at casting young Abraham into the fiery furnace. Psychologists
may find in this story, and especially in this particular moment of the story,
a psychological explanation for the adult <span class=GramE>Abraham' s</span>
behavior towards those around him - and even perhaps towards his two sons, Ishmael
and Isaac.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(section39, pg. 365)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>, tells us how Abraham reached the
conclusion that the world has a Creator. He once saw a building that was lit-up
inside. Abraham said: &quot;Could it be that this building has no owner?&quot; The
owner of the building looked [out the window] and said to him: &quot;I am <span
class=GramE>the</span> owner of the building!&quot; The <span class=SpellE>midrash</span>
continues to explain the analogy: &quot;So it was that Abraham our Father <span
class=SpellE>said'Perhaps</span> the world has no ruler,' <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>and the Holy One blessed be He looked out and
told <span class=SpellE>him'I</span> am the ruler, master of the entire world.'
<span class=GramE>&quot; According</span> to the author of this <span
class=SpellE>midrash</span>, Abraham was unique in his generation in having the
ability to look at reality and derive highly significant conclusions from it. Abraham
was like a scientific genius who looks at the same data as do all the other
members of the scientific community but is able to deduce revolutionary
consequences from them. To this intellectual trait was added the social trait
discussed above. Together they allowed Abraham to persist in holding opinions
that were not accepted in his milieu and to stand up for his own world view. In
this spirit Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Yehuda</span> said (<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>
<span class=SpellE>Rabba</span> section 41, pg. 414) that the name <span
class=SpellE><i>Avraham</i></span><i> ha' <span class=SpellE>Ivri</span></i>

style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>After Abraham was weaned, while still an
infant, his mind began to reflect. By day and by night he was thinking and
wondering: &quot;How is it possible that this [celestial] sphere could continuously
be guiding the world and have no one to guide it and cause it to turn round;
for it cannot be that it turns round of itself.&quot; He had no teacher, no one
to instruct him in thought. He was submerged in Ur of the <span class=SpellE>Chaldees</span>,
among silly idolaters. His father and mother and the entire population
worshipped idols, and he worshiped with them. But his mind was busily working
and reflecting until he had attained the way of truth, apprehended the correct
line of thought, and knew that there is one God, that He guides the celestial
sphere and created everything, and that among all that exist, there is no god
beside Him. He realized that men everywhere were in error, and that what had
occasioned their error was that they worshiped the stars and the images, so
that the truth perished from their minds. Abraham was forty years old when he
recognized his Creator. Having attained this knowledge, he began to refute the
inhabitants of Ur of the <span class=SpellE>Chaldees</span>, arguing with them
and saying to them, &quot;The course you are following is not the way of truth.&quot;
He broke the images and commenced to instruct the people that it was not right
to serve any one but the God of the universe, to whom alone it was proper to
bow down, offer up sacrifices and make libations, so that all human creators
might, in the future, know Him; and that it was proper to destroy and shatter
all the images, so that the people might not err like these who thought that
there was no god but these images<o:p></o:p></span></p>

defect&quot; that allowed him to attain his intellectual, spiritual, and
political achievements. His ability to disconnect from his surroundings and
cast off deep-rooted world-views granted him the ability to leave normative
positions behind him and adopt new ones. Similar abilities sometimes help
political leaders, military commanders, scientists, artists, and philosophers
to take on new stances even when these are opposed to popular opinion. Sometimes
one needs a certain degree of social isolation in order to be brave and
non-conformist; one needs a certain degree of social isolation in order to chart
out a path that is independent, opposed to the &quot;tribe&quot; and the family
that nourished the individual and in which he grew. The proof of intellectual
courage is that you cling to the truth even when it is not convenient for those
around you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the people flocked to him and questioned him regarding his assertions, he would
instruct each one according to his capacity till he had brought him to the way
of truth, and thus thousands and tens of thousands joined him. These were the
persons referred to in the phrase, &quot;men of the house of Abraham.&quot; Abraham
implanted in their hearts this great doctrine, composed books on it, and taught
it to Isaac, his son. Isaac settled down, instructing and exhorting. He
imparted the doctrine to Jacob and ordained him to teach it. He, too, settled

noticed that these two character traits - that which is inward-directed as well

philosophical doctrine, especially as it is expressed in his philosophical
works. On the one hand <span class=SpellE>RaMBaM</span> praises isolation in
the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> (3:51) as a means for religious meditation,

necessary lessons from it. We are required to remember our servitude in Egypt
and the Exodus also in order that we treat fairly the strangers living in our
midst. The memory of <span class=SpellE>Amalek</span> serves, among other
things, to help us overcome the universal tendency of all individuals and
societies to exploit and oppress the weak and to help us gain victory over the
evil in our midst.</p>

fact that on the night of the 12<sup>th</sup> of Heshvan 5756 Yitzhak Rabin,
the prime minister of Israel, was murdered because one young man believed on
the basis of his twisted religious belief, that he was obligated to do so in
order to save the Jewish People.</p>

those parts of the Land of Israel lying beyond the &quot;green line&quot; and
surrounding our relations with the Palestinians are just as alive today as they
were in the period leading up to the murder. Like denial of the Holocaust,
denial of the murder can, God forbid, create an atmosphere that justifies
violence as an expression of political protest. Will we know to remember this,
to remind ourselves and warn of the dangers that are no less serious than the
Iranian threat?</p>
