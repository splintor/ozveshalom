<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Rambam believed that curses have no power to
bodily harm the object of the curse; but he did consider cursing to be a
serious transgression &quot;for in the opinion of the multitude the injury
resulting from curses is greater than that which may befall the body&quot;
(Guide for the Perplexed, III, 41). By his use of the word &quot;multitude&quot;,
Rambam is hinting to the fact that the harm of curses is not real, but
imagined, i.e., psychological. Accordingly, Rambam, in the Book of Mitzvoth
(Negative Precept 317), explains the prohibition against cursing a deaf person,
even though the curse cannot hurt the one cursed. On the other hand, the author
of the Sefer Hachinuch opines that a curse can indeed harm the cursed; one's
soul has the power to influence another, and this is true especially with
regard to the righteous &quot;For in proportion to the importance of the soul
and the degree in which the soul of <i>tzaddikim and hassidim</i> cleave to the
higher powers, will their words affect all of which they speak&quot; etc.
(Mitzva 231).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent dir=LTR style='text-indent:1.0cm'>The position of
the author of the Chinuch was accepted by most people in the pre-modern era,
and it definitely reflects the world view of Balak, King of Moab. But whoever
believes in the efficacy of the curse, would also seem to believe in divine
supervision, and therefore Balak's initiative to curse Israel is puzzling:
Considering the history of the Israelites in their confrontations with their
enemies - especially in the recent one with Sichon and Og, how could Balak have
hoped that God would assist him?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>According to the Midrash, Balak &quot;foresaw
the misfortune due to befall Israel in the future&quot; (Tanhuma, Balak, 2) and
he hoped that the present time would be propitious for this misfortune. Another
Midrash explains similarly that astrologers revealed to Balak that &quot;Israel
will fall in his hands&quot; (B'midbar Rabba, 20, 7)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><b>I should like to develop the idea shared
by these two midrashim in a new direction, to suggest that Balak hoped that his
request would be answered by means of a new technique of prophecy.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>We read that on the morrow of Bil'am's
arrival at Kiryath-huzoth, on the boundary with Moav: &quot;<i>In the morning,
Balak took Bil'am up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see a portion of the
people.&quot; </i>(B'midbar 22:41)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The intent was that Bil'am should curse the
Israelite nation there. Why <b>there? </b>Because from that point the prophet
(the &quot;seer&quot;) could see &quot;<i>a portion of the people&quot;. </i>The
attempt failed, perhaps because Bil'am was not faithful to the method. Bil'am
commanded Balak to build seven altars and to offer sacrifices, but then he
deviated from the plan. Bil'am said to Balak: &quot;<i>Stand here by your
offerings while I am gone&quot; </i>(23:3); he ordered Bil'am to remain in the
alter area, but he himself left the place with its unique perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This scenario repeats itself in the second
attempt. Balak invites Bil'am to go with him to a different location, one from
which &quot;<i>you can see them - you will see only a portion of them; you will
not see all of them&quot; </i>(23:13), that is to say, the same kind of
observation point. Again Bil'am instructs Balak: <i>&quot;Stay here beside your
offerings, while I seek a manifestation yonder&quot;. </i>Again, Bil'am does
not remain with Balak at the observation point; again the attempt is doomed to
failure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Only now does Balak forgo his approach, i.e.,
the plan that Bil'am view only a small part of Israel. Out of despair and
fatalistic curiosity, he takes Bil'am to &quot;<i>the peak of Peor, which
overlooks the wasteland&quot;, </i>and after the offering of sacrifices, Bil'am
&quot;<i>turned his face toward the wilderness.&quot; </i>From there, Bil'am
sees &quot;<i>Israel encamped tribe by tribe,&quot; </i>the nation in its
entirety - and the result is well-known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The central principle of the prophetic method
which Balak suggested was the need <b>to limit the field of vision, </b>to view
only part of the people. What can be the underlying assumption of this
technique? May I suggest that Balak thought that there was a connection between
<b>optical vision and prophetic vision. </b>This can be seem from the third
vision, the richest and most far-reaching of the vision, which flowed directly
from the fact that this time Bil'am climbed to the point from which he could
have unlimited view of the entire congregation. It is clear that Balak assumed
that a wide perspective would foil his plan, and that Bil'am could damn Israel
only if his field of vision was very narrow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This concept is comprehensible if it is based
on the assumption that the prophet's chronological vision grows in proportion
to the openness and breadth of his optical vision. If Balak strove to limit Bil'am's
field of vision, it was probably because he understood that eventually his
nation must fall in the hands of Israel, &quot;<i>as an ox licks up the grass
of the field.&quot; </i>His hope was for a short-range solutioin, to overcome
Israel in the impending struggle. Therefore he sought to limit Bil'am's field of
vision and evoke a curse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This approach explains how Balak, who
believed in the Lord, in prophecy and the election of Israel, can hope that Bil'am
receive consent of the Lord to curse Israel. We also understand the sense of
confidence which Balak exhibits, in contrast to the lack of enthusiasm on the
part of Bil'am, who, it seems, did not recognize Balak's method and perhaps did
not understand it. This suggested approach also explains the technical steps of
the three attempts, with the ascent to a certain type of observation post -
ostensibly strange - and the three failed attempts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0cm;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Ramban approximates this explanation in his
commentary to the passage &quot;<i>Balak took Bil'am up to Bamoth-baal; from
there he could see a portion of the people.&quot; </i>Ramban was alert to the
connection between optical and prophetic vision: &quot;He took him to a place
from where he could see them in order that he concentrate on them in his curse
and his soul not detach itself from them, for these are part of the powers of
the soul, to cleave during the seeing&quot; etc. Regarding the second attempt,
writes Ramban: &quot;But curse them for me from there if you can, for there I
have no place to curse all of them from there.&quot; According to Ramban, the
limitation of perspective was fortuitous, but not desirable from Balak's point
of view. I, on the contrary, suggest that the very opposite is correct: <b>Balak
considered the restricted field of optical vision the key to limitation of the
prophetic field of vision, and hoped that this technique would enable Bil'am to
prophesy a disaster for Israel in the immediate future.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom is a movement dedicated to the advancement of
a civil society in Israel. It is committed to promoting the ideals of
tolerance, pluralism, and justice, concepts which have always been central to
Jewish tradition and law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom shares a deep attachment to the land of
Israel and it no less views peace as a central religious value. It believes
that Jews have both the religious and the national obligation to support the
pursuit of peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a
fair and just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an
option but an imperative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom's programs include both educational and
protest activities. Seminars, lectures, workshops, conferences and weekend
programs are held for students, educators and families, as well as joint
seminars for Jews, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. Protest activities focus on
issues of human rights, co-existence between Jews and Arabs, and responses to
issues of particular religious relevance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>9,000 copies of a 4 page peace oriented commentary on the weekly Torah
reading are written and published by Oz VeShalom/Netivot Shalom and they are
distributed to over 350 synagogues in Israel and are sent overseas via email.
Our web site is www.netivot-shalom.org.il.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom's educational forums draw people of different
backgrounds, secular and religious, who are keen to deepen their Jewish
knowledge and to hear an alternative religious standpoint on the subjects of
peace and social issues.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText3 dir=LTR>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom fills an ideological
vacuum in Israel's society. Committed both to Jewish tradition and observance, and
to the furthering of peace and coexistence, the movement is in a unique
position to engage in dialogue with the secular left and the religious right,
with Israeli Arabs and with Palestinians.</p>
