<H2>Abraham, Lot, the Canaanite, and the Promise of the Land</H2>
 <H3>Pinhas Leiser</H3> 

<p align="justify">Abraham and Lot began their journey together, as it is written;
"And Lot went with him" (Genesis 12:4).  We can understand from their  walking
together that at the beginning of his way Lot joined Abraham and  connected his fate and
goals to the fate of his uncle, who walked  following G-d's command from his country and
homeland to an unknown  country.</p>

<p align="justify">The Torah  tells us very little about Lot and his acceptance of the
vision in which Abraham was willing to leave the known and build a  new culture, a
culture of faith and lovingkindness.</p>

<p align="justify"> Lot accompanied Abraham on his journey from Haran to the Land of Canaan,
apparently joined Abraham when he traveled to Egypt following the famine
in Canaan and returned with Abraham to Canaan, when both had accumulated
great wealth (Bereishit 13:2-5).</p>

<p align="justify"> Abraham apparently had an additional Individual accompanying him on his  journey. At
each stop along the way, a connection was established  between Abraham and G-d.
Within this connection G-d sometimes revealed  Himself to Abraham, and other times
Abraham built an altar for "the G-d  who appears to Him".  G-d punished Pharaoh, who
took Sarai, Abraham's  wife-sister and indirectly caused Abraham's return to Canaan.
Lot did  not share in Abraham's connection with G-d.</p>

<p align="justify">Upon their return to Canaan, there is a radical change in the
relationship between Abraham and Lot (Genesis 13:6-12). This change is  consummated
when they separate and each goes his own way.  Upon a  first reading, it simply appears
that overcrowded conditions prevented  Abraham and Lot from dwelling near each other.</p>

<p align="justify">Rashi, following the Sages in Bereishit Rabbah, examines the tension between the
herdsmen of Abraham and those of Lot in a different light: "'And there was a quarrel'
because Lot's shepherds were wicked men and grazed their cattle in other people's
fields.  Abraham's shepherds rebuked them
for this act of robbery, but they replied, 'The land has been given to  Abram, and since he
has no son as heir, Lot will be his heir - consequently this is not robbery'.  Scripture,
however, states: 'The  Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land', so that Abram
was  not yet entitled to possession" (Rashi on Bereishit, Ch. 13:7).  The  disagreement
between Abram's herdsmen, who likely accepted Abram's  values and followed his
instructions, and Lot's herdsmen takes place, as  described by Rashi, within the context
of a value system.  Two different  perspectives on G-d's promise emerge here.
Abraham's perspective is  influenced by his constant, direct communication with G-d.  Lot
and then his herdsmen understand G-d's promise as an absolute  declaration in which
profit and power can be gained and this promise may  be carried out immediately.  All this
also results in the rejection of  any other considerations.  According to this perspective,
neither the  present reality nor moral considerations which might prevent the promise
from being carried out should be taken into account, since G-d's promise  is above all
else.</p>

<p align="justify">In contrast to Lot, Abraham and his herdsmen comprehend the importance  of
distinguishing between G-d's promise and the existing reality.  They  also understand
that moral considerations involving G-d's promise must  be taken into account since
Abraham's G-d, being "the Judge of  the Land" would not "allow injustice to reign".</p>

<p align="justify">Because Abraham felt gratitude to G-d for the promise granted to him, he
was profoundly anxious about the realization of this promise.  When Abraham reached
Alon Moreh, G-d revealed Himself to Abraham and promised him  that He would give his
descendents the land of Canaan.  Abraham responded by building an altar "to G-d who
appeared to him".  Rashi,  following the Midrash, provides this commentary: "for the good
tidings  that he would have children, and for the good tidings that they would  possess
the land of Israel" (Rashi Bereishit 12:7).  Abraham's act of  building an altar is then a
religious response in an expression of  gratitude.</p>

<p align="justify">The next verse (12:8) mentions that Abraham builds another altar.  Here
Rashi again writes following the Midrash: "And he built there an altar -
He perceived through the gift of prophecy that his descendents would once
stumble there through Achan's transgression: therefore  he prayed there for them" (Rashi
Bereishit, 12:8).</p>

<p align="justify">Abraham understands that in spite of G-d's promise, his children might
misinterpret the moral significance of the promise and be dragged down.   They might
commit undesirable acts as a result of impulses stimulated by  the act of conquering the
land (Achan).  The second altar that Abraham  builds expresses this anxiety and
represents both the hope and prayer  that in the end his descendents will be worthy of
the promise (Achan's transgression  occurred during the conquest of the land between
Beth-El and Ai).  When  the land was promised once more to Abraham in a pact of the
halves,  Abraham asks, "How can I really know that it will be mine?" (Genesis  15:8).  The
commentators Rabbi Ovadiah from Solfranu, the Sforno, and  the Ramban provide us
with their interpretations.  The Sforno writes:</p>

<p align="justify"><BLOCKQUOTE>"Whereby shall I know?  Perhaps my children will sin and not bear to
inherit it."  (Sforno, Bereishit 15:8)</BLOCKQUOTE></p>

The Ramban writes: <BLOCKQUOTE><p align="justify">"When Abraham asked, 'How can I really know that it
will be mine?' he did not expect to receive a sign.  G-d did not show him, as in other signs
or miracles, a wondrous act, but asked Abraham to  know that the land would be his.
Neither he nor his descendents should  commit a sin preventing this from happening and
the Canaanites would not  repent , so that the following prophecy would occur:.  'At one
instant I may speak about plucking  up, breaking down, or destroying a nation.  If,
however, that nation  turns from its evil ways because of my words against it, I repent of
the  evil I thought of inflicting upon it.' (Jeremiah 18:7-8).  G-d, who made  a covenant with
Abraham, will fulfill His promise in any case." (Ramban  Bereishit 15:7).</BLOCKQUOTE></p>

<p align="justify">Abraham is afraid then that the realization of the promise will depend
on the actions of his children and is therefore very concerned.  The promise is
strengthened by the establishment of the covenant.  The  reality of the covenant creates
an additional meaning, that of  reciprocity, according to Rashi: "And I will establish My
covenant - And  what is this Covenant?  To be a G-d unto thee.  For an everlasting
possession - and there I will be your G-d. (Rashi, Bereishit, 17:7-8)  That is, the promise
made because of the covenant is not a guarantor or  deed of registry.  The existence of
the covenant between G-d and  Abraham's descendents is conditional on "being a G-d
unto thee."  However, there is a lasting imprint of the covenant passed down from
generation to generation through the ritual of circumcision, that is the  covenant of our
father, Abraham.  The possession is everlasting in the  spiritual realm.  It is not, however,
a prize, but an anchor in reality  enabling the fulfillment of the spiritual and moral vision
where "there  I will be your G-d."</p>

<p align="justify">Lot is not a partner in this vision, as Rashi writes following the
Midrash (Rashi on Bereishit 13:11):  "And Lot journeyed from the East (mikedem):  He
roved away from the First Essence of the World (mikadmono shel olam)  He wandered
away from the Creator of the Universe, saying, 'I want  neither Abram nor his
G-d' (Gen. R. 41). 
 The absence of Abraham's G-d in  Lot's journey, the judge of all the land and the G-d of
lovingkindness,  is an essential element in Lot's concrete and absolute understanding of
G-d promise.</p>

<p align="justify">Abraham is able to distinguish between the promise he believes in, the  promise given
as part of a covenant, and the practical and moral  prospects in the realization of that
promise.  Abraham is very anxious  about the potential dangers involved in transforming
the promise into  reality.</p>

<p align="justify">In the Biblical story, the only way for Abraham to deal with this
struggle is "to separate from me".  Abraham probably understood that the
land "could not support them to dwell together".  The deep ideological
conflict between the two views would not enable the continuation of  their
journey together.  These differences could even deteriorate into a  state
of civil war resulting in bloodshed.  Therefore, the separation  enabled each of
them to choose the path they believed in.  This separation enables us to
examine the potential results of the  different ways Lot and Abraham
chose.
At the end of the story Lot  reached Sodom, a city full of evil and sinful
inhabitants and he needs Abraham's  help to save him.  The entire land,
including that of Lot, was promised  to Abram, who upheld the conditions of the
covenant.  This story, as a "sign passed down to the coming generations", enables  us to
examine the relationship between G-d's promise and the concrete  reality.  We must take
into account moral values, which constitute an  important aspect of this promise.
Peaceful coexistence is apparently  impossible between  "Abram's herdsmen" and "Lot's
herdsmen".  In order  to avoid a bloody conflict (as between Cain and Abel, in which the
Midrash assigns their disagreement a moral character), the two sides  should peacefully
separate or find an alternate way to peacefully settle  the conflict.</p>

<p align="justify">We are in pain upon realizing that what happened three years ago on the  Saturday
night following Lech Lecha proves this all too clearly.</p>
