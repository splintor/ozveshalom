</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most parshiot in the Book of Bereishit begin with a new story. The curtain goes down,  and then comes up  . . . on  another time, another place and, as a rule, with new personae &ndash; characters who did not appear in the previous parasha at all, or played  secondary roles. But Parashat  "<I>Vayigash" </I>not only opens in the middle of the story of the brothers' descent into Egypt; it opens in the middle of a scene which began in the preceding parasha, "<I>Miketz". </I>One gets the impression that the narrator interrupted the flow of the narrative to announce: "Pay attention! Something very important is about to occur!"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A palace in the Land of Egypt, a stern nobleman sits in council, surrounded by his servants and advisers. Before him, eleven trembling nomads, who came from the Land of Canaan to purchase food in Egypt, but got embroiled in a conflict with the master of the house. He does not covet their money. He sends away and recalls, befriends and abruptly alienates -  and now he accuses the youngest of theft.  The nobleman is Yosef, the shepherds,  his brothers. The shepherds are unaware that the nobleman is their brother, they are bewildered by what is happening. They scrutinize their past, seeking a reason for the calamity which has befallen them. Thus do we react in times of adversity. In Parashat "<I>Miketz"</I> we heard them say: <I>"Truly we are guilty  concerning our brother!  -- that we saw his heart's distress when he implored us, and we did not listen"</I> (Bereishit 42:21)   Yosef hears everything and understands everything, yet he is not satisfied, and therefore he continues. Throughout the generations, commentators sought and suggested explanations for Yosef's behavior. Those commentators who lived in Galut were very fond of Yosef, calling him "<I>Yosef HaTzaddik" </I> "Yosef the Righteous," and included him among the <I>ushpizin &ndash; </I>the guests &ndash; invited to our <I>sukkah</I>. But it is very important to examine another character which develops in the Yosef stories, reaching full realization in Parashat "<I>VaYigash".</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new type  of  founding father appears. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Book of Bereishit presents Yehuda gradually. In the beginning, we meet him as one of the brothers, his position somewhat elevated by the fact of his being born to Leah and not to one of the maidservants. Yehuda's roll in the selling of Yosef is subject to controversy.  The idea of selling Yosef to the Yishmaelites was his; unlike his brother Reuven, he had no intention of saving Yosef from the hands of his ruffian brothers.  On the other hand, he did not agree to leave Yosef in the pit &ndash; Reuven's misbegotten idea &ndash; for it seemed to him to be a death sentence. The selling of Yosef to seemed to be a logical solution which would satisfy Shimon and Levi, yet save Yosef's life. Be it as it may, Yehuda spoke and his brothers acted accordingly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selling of Yosef is followed immediately by the story of Tamar, wife of Er. Yehuda marries a Canaanite woman, and two of their three offspring die. Yehuda tries to put off  his twice-widowed daughter-in-law, who waits to marry his third son. He visits a 'prostitute' during working hours, but when the affair comes to light, he does not react <I>a la</I> Shimon and Levi; he accepts pregnant Tamar into his household. He may have been a schemer; he may have succumbed to strong sexual urges; God did not speak to him, nor did he address God. But he was a decent person, a "mentsch". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Parashat "<I>Miketz" </I> Yaakov is asked to send his youngest son to the capricious nobleman in Egypt. Again Reuven demonstrates his combination of weakness and foolishness when he suggests "<I>My two sons shall you kill if I do not return him to you."</I>  Indeed! This would be exactly what Yaakov would need to console him over the loss of Benyamin &ndash; two dead grandsons!  The famine intensifies, the storerooms empty out, and Yehuda decides he must act. He speaks to his father in language which is stern, but which holds out hope: "<I>Send the lad with me and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, so, so you, so our little-ones! I will act as his pledge, at my hand you may seek him! If I do not bring him back to you and set him in your presence, I will be culpable- for- sin against  you all the days (to come)."</I> Yehuda is offering Yaakov not only hope, but partnership in responsibility for Benyamin's future. Yaakov accedes, and the caravan sets out on its journey. Upon reaching Egypt, Yaakov's dark premonition is realized: the capricious nobleman 'frames' Benyamin, plotting to keep him by his side. . . him alone, without his brothers. Yehuda, now the recognized leader of the brothers, tries to plead, to persuade, to implore. "At least do not separate between us," he begs of the nobleman.  The nobleman is adamant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A rabbinical midrash portrays Yehuda as a fire-breathing lion, capable of devastating Egypt;  only Yosef's words of ethical reprimand prevent him for doing so (in another midrash, Yosef's revelation to his brothers averts the catastrophe). But the plain reading of the text presents a different picture &ndash; one horribly clear.  Yosef is all-powerful . . . the brothers are hungry and weak like migrant workers in America of the Great Depression. Like young Henry Fonda in John Ford's "Grapes of Wrath", Yehuda moves into the foreground and says, "This far. No further."  Thus opens Parashat "<I>Vayigash".</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yehuda begins with words of deference and courtesy; he then describes the terrible misfortune of his aged father. He lost one son, and now he is asked to give up his 'baby' &ndash; a loss which will hasten his death. If you want to kill my father, says Yehuda, you'll have to do it without me. Yehuda is prepared to pay a personal price: "<I>So now, pray let your servant stay instead f the lad, as servant to my lord, but let the lad go up with his brothers!"</I> (Bereishit 44:33)   We are only too familiar with these speeches. They can be heard daily in the welfare offices, in the police stations, in demonstrations in front of the Knesset.  Nine times out of ten they end with no consequences.  We can assume that in Egypt of  the Pharaohs, nine out of ten ministers would have sentenced the impudent nomad to death. The brothers were lucky; they happened upon the tenth. His hard heart softens, and he bursts into tears. (Bereishit 45:1)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An imprudent <I>darshan </I>might portray Yehuda as a resourceful, smooth-talking salesman who knows how to suit the speech to the listener, to cause everyone to react according to his demands. . . first the brothers, then Yaakov, then Yosef. But such a midrash would be ignoring the fact that Yehuda did not know what we, the readers, know. He could not know that inside the harsh and capricious official hides a rejected child who devised for himself a corrective experience of international propor. Neither wizard with words nor a fire-breathing lion, Yehuda was an aging nomad shepherd, himself a father who lost sons, who,  in an extremely difficult moment, did the right thing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following scene, with its embraces, kisses, and tears, has been much subjected to 'symposiums' in Sunday morning '<I>She'at mechanech" </I>&ndash; home room teacher's hour. "If Yehuda and Yosef reconciled, the Tribes of Yehuda and Efrayim can behave similarly, for the sake of national unity and  other miscellany".  But we, Zionists of the end of the sixth millenium, we will remember the beginning of Parashat "<I>Vayigash" &ndash; </I>the moment in which our father Yehuda steps forward, alone, and takes upon his shoulders the responsibility for the welfare of his father and his brothers. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>His heart failed . . . their father Yaakov's spirit came to life": </I>The Connection Between Body And Soul</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>His heart failed" </I>His heart stopped beating and his breathing ceased, for cardiac activity stopped and he was as dead. This is a known phenomenon resulting from sudden joy. Medical texts state that the aged and weak may not be able to withstand this; many faint at the sudden reception of good tidings; the heart suddenly expands and opens, and the warmed blood goes out and spreads throughout the external portions of the body, and as a result of its cooling, the heart ceases. The old man fell as if dead, and he said that he believed them not, informing us that he stood a good part of the day, and he lies in silence because he did not believe them, for he knew that this fainting would lead to their shouting at him , normalizing him with this joy until it is absorbed in calm. This is the reason that "<I>they spoke to him all of Yosef's words which he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons etc." &ndash; </I>they were shouting Yosef's words into his ears, and bringing the wagons before him, and then his spirit returned to him, and his breathing was restored, and he lived, and this is the meaning of "<B><I>their father Yaakov's spirit came to life."</B></I><FONT SIZE=3> </P>

But they will fearlessly declare the unpleasant truth; the Egyptians' abhorrence of their occupation, and the nations'  general loathing of the of Jews, are the primary means of survival for this tribe which is destined to pass the days in isolation. As long as the light of morality has not dawned upon the nations, the barriers which the nations raised against Yisrael protects him from contamination  by the corruption of the peoples among whom he will walk for centuries. <FONT SIZE=3>&#9;</P>
