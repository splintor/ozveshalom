camp in the times of King Hezekiah, and he undermined His actions, for now they
had to fight by themselves. And regarding the statement regarding God being
weak, it seems to me that according to His original intent the land should have
been given to them miraculously. And regarding the hiding of God's words, that
he hid some of His words, for He said&quot;... that I am giving the Children of
Israel&quot; (<span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bemidbar</span></span><span

wage war, so that they need not fear defeat, and by his speaking about defeat
in battle, he hid His words &quot;...that I am giving&quot;, as if He had never
spoken them... he spoke words in order to frighten Israel.</p>

the repetition? [It may be a repetition for stylistic purposes, but the
question still joins the preceding ones].</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The Bible's
style of writing sometimes integrates two <span class=SpellE><i>parshiyot</i></span>
into one. Above, we attempted to define the two <span class=SpellE>parshiyot</span>
by assigning different fonts to each <span class=SpellE><i>parasha</i></span>,
thus receiving two coherent stories. <span style='font-family:Arial'>In the
first, in this font (Arial)</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>, </span>God
commands to make fringes on the corners of the garments in order that they
remember all the commandments and they <span class=GramE>be</span> a holy
people to the Lord who redeemed them from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> so that He be unto them a
Lord. In the story appearing <span style='font-family:Century'>in this font (Century)</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span>He orders that upon the fringes should be
placed an indigo twist and it shall be a fringe - a second fringe. The purpose
of these fringes is also to remind us of all the mitzvoth, but also to prevent succumbing
to the enticing heart and eyes. The three repetitions quoted in our questions,
derive from the existence of two stories, each containing the three motifs:
fringes, remembrance and identity: &quot;I am the Lord&quot;. There appears
here an important principle of memory theory. Memory is always memory within
memory, just as forgetting is forgetting within forgetting. Human consciousness
is composed of layers and folds. Something slips a bit from one's <span
class=GramE>memory,</span> and later it slips yet more. Something returns a bit
and then it can return yet more. A one-time violent remembrance can cause
externalization. Internalization occurs only in memory which follows memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>R. Meir says.
Why is blue singled out from all the varieties of colors? Because blue
resembles the color of the sea, and the sea resembles the color of the sky, and
the sky resembles the color of a sapphire, and a sapphire resembles the color
of the Throne of Glory, as it is said: &quot;And they saw the God of Israel and
there was under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone&quot;; and
it is also written: &quot;The likeness of a throne as the appearance of a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The memory
moves gently, from layer to layer, from hue to hue. The Sages fashioned a
reality in which the <span class=SpellE><i>tsitsit</i></span><i> </i>meet man
in the depths of the material world, and reminds him of his values:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>Once a man,
who was very scrupulous about the precept of zizith, heard of a certain harlot
in one of the towns by the sea who accepted <span class=GramE>four hundred gold
[<span class=SpellE>denars</span>] for her hire</span>. He sent <span
class=GramE>her four hundred gold [<span class=SpellE>denars</span>]</span> and
appointed a day with her. When the day arrived he came and waited at her door,
and her maid came and told her, '<span class=GramE>That</span> man who sent you
four hundred gold [<span class=SpellE>denars</span>] is here and waiting at the
door'; to which she replied 'Let him come in'. When he came in she prepared for
him seven beds, six of silver and one of gold; and between one bed and the
other there were steps of silver, but the last were of gold. She then went up
to the top bed and lay down upon it naked. He too went up after her in his
desire to sit naked with her, when all of a sudden the four fringes [of his
garment] struck him across the face; whereupon he slipped off and sat upon the
ground. She also slipped off and sat upon the ground and said, 'By the Roman
Capitol, I will not leave you alone until you tell me what blemish you saw in
me. 'By the Temple', he replied, 'never have I seen a woman as beautiful as you
are; but there is one precept which the Lord our God has commanded us, it is
called zizith, and with regard to it the expression 'I am the Lord your God' is
twice written, signifying, I am He who will exact punishment in the future, and
I am He who will give reward in the future. Now [the zizith] appeared to me as
four witnesses testifying against me'. She said, 'I will not leave you until
you tell me your name, the name of your town, the name of your teacher, the
name of your school in which you study the Torah'. He wrote all this down and
handed it to her. Thereupon she arose and divided her estate into three parts;
one third for the government, one third to be distributed among the poor, and
one third she took with her in her hand; the linens however, she retained. She
then came to the Beth <span class=SpellE>Hamidrash</span> of R. <span
class=SpellE>Hiyya</span>, and said to him, 'Master, give me instructions and
convert me.' 'My daughter', he replied; 'perhaps you have set your eyes on one
of the disciples?' She thereupon took out the script and handed it to him. 'Go',
said he 'and enjoy your acquisition'. Those very linens which she had spread
for him for an illicit purpose she now spread out for him lawfully. This is the
reward [for the precept] in this world; and as for its reward in the future
world I know not how great it is. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tractate <span

change man's nature, unable to bring him to faith, and certainly not to the
repair of the entire nation. One incapable of recognizing from within himself
his status before God and its ensuing commitments will never <span class=GramE>achieve</span>
this awareness through any external agent. This conclusion is valid not only
with regard to the distant past, but also to the present and future; Divine
supervision and all that is humanly perceived to be &quot;the finger of
God&quot; cannot bring men to find their way even in political, national or
social matters... the correct path in management of the world, the state and
society or the determination of historical courses of events. All these flow
from human understanding, with the reaching of conclusions and making
decisions. Paths of action are never given man as a grant, through the medium
of wondrous revelation, by supernatural means.</p>

not to the subject of &quot;God and Man&quot; but the subject of &quot;Mitzvoth
and Man&quot; (&quot;...<i>and you shall remember all God's commands, and you
will observe them... so that you remember and perform all <span class=GramE>My</span>
commands...&quot;</i>)<i>.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>Remembrance
is a thing of the heart, and, at first blush, it would have seemed possible to
combine it with &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;love&quot; in their abstract sense;
but Scripture states the meaning of remembrance is<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span style='letter-spacing:1.3pt'>the
doing</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>of the <span
class=SpellE>mitzvot</span>. Remembrance of God exists in the believer's
consciousness on one of two planes: that of &quot;<span class=SpellE>Shema</span>&quot;
(pure belief '<span class=SpellE><i>lishemah</i></span><i>',<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>with no ulterior motive) - God is
the Lord; and the second plane, that of &quot;<i>And if you will carefully
obey&quot;<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>(belief '<span
class=SpellE><i>shelo</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>lishmah</span>' -<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>with ulterior motive) - God is the
supra-Minister of Finance, supra-Minister of Health, supra-Minister of
Security, etc. But regardless of whether one remembers God on the &quot;<span
class=SpellE><i>Shema</i></span><i>&quot;<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>plane
or on the &quot;<i>And if you will carefully obey&quot;<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>plane - both obligate the
observance of mitzvoth.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.7pt'>At
the conclusion of <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Tsitsit</span>,
which concludes the <span class=SpellE>Kriyat</span> <span class=SpellE>Shema</span>,
there appears a concept with specifically religious significance, the concept
of<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span><i>
-<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>holiness: &quot;<i>And you
shall be holy&quot;.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>This
concept has no meaning outside the world of religious faith. True, the concept
has filtered into the day-to-day vernacular, taking on secular meanings, such
as: &quot;The memory of my late mother is holy to me&quot; - but in such as
case it is no more than an idiom with emotional content. In its original and
essential meaning, &quot;holy&quot; refers only to God; therefore it cannot be
explained through concepts taken from human thought or in other terms from
human language, and it cannot be applied to anything found in the world. In
human reality the category of &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span><i>&quot;</i><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>can be used only to designate activity
directed toward the &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>kadosh</i></span><i>&quot; -<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>the Holy One&quot; - a designation
of the service of God through observance of the mitzvoth. It designates the
purpose and goal to which one must strive, and also the striving itself, but it
does not designate any given or existing thing. In human reality, there is only
functional<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span><i>;<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>the essential<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>is God's alone. Whoever attributes<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span><span
class=apple-converted-space><i>&nbsp;</i></span>to anything from the natural or
artificial reality - to man, to the land, to an institution, to an edifice, to
an object - is guilty of idol worship; he raises it to the level of the divine.
This is the great meaning presented to man by the mitzvah of <span
class=SpellE>Tsitsit</span>: &quot;<i><span style='letter-spacing:1.2pt'>so
that you remember and perform all My commands and you will be holy</span>...<span
class=GramE><span style='letter-spacing:1.2pt'>&quot;;</span></span><span
class=apple-converted-space><span style='letter-spacing:1.2pt'>&nbsp;</span></span></i>that
is to say, you are not holy by virtue of your essence; your holiness is not
something which exists in yourself; it is something for you to achieve. The
mission is eternal, because it is tied to a condition which can be fulfilled
only with eternal effort.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.7pt'>We
bring the words of one of the greatest Torah scholars and believers, one of the
greatest religious thinker of recent generations, Rabbi Meir <span
class=SpellE>Simcha</span> <span class=SpellE>HaCohen</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Dvinsk</span>, author of the &quot;<span class=SpellE>Meshech</span>
<span class=SpellE>Chochma</span>&quot;. Many times, with great emphasis, he
repeats in his book his explanation that &quot;there is nothing holy in the
world... only the Lord, Blessed Be He, is holy, and only He is deserving of
praise and service&quot;; no creation has holiness - only the Creator, Blessed
Be He&quot;; &quot;all things considered holy - <span class=SpellE>Eretz</span>
<span class=SpellE>Yisrael</span>, <span class=SpellE>Yerushalayim</span>, the
Temple Mount, the <span class=SpellE>Mikdash</span>, the Tablets of the Law -
none of these possess intrinsic holiness, but they were sanctified through
action and mitzvoth.&quot; Therefore, when <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> repudiates the Torah and
violates the mitzvoth - all the above lose their holiness, they become profane.
He repeats this idea again and again: &quot;Do not imagine that the mount is
something holy...<span class=GramE>&quot; ;</span> &quot;...Do not imagine that
the <span class=SpellE>Mishkan</span> and the <span class=SpellE>Mikdash</span>
are, in themselves, holy entities&quot; and many more such statements. In one
place he adds the remark &quot;This is a weighty matter&quot; - as though he
had foreseen how &quot;religious&quot; Jews, 50 years after his death, would
disgrace and profane the concept of &quot;<span class=SpellE>kedusha</span>&quot;
by exploiting as cover for satisfaction of human needs and interests - private
or communal.</p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.7pt'>It
seems that Torah desired to instill in us the deep religious significance of
&quot;<span class=SpellE>kedusha</span>&quot;, and therefore it placed the
story of <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> in juxtaposition to the <span
class=SpellE>parasha</span> of <span class=SpellE>Tsitsit</span>. A space of
only three lines separates between the great programmatic proclamation of faith
voiced by Moshe our Teacher (&quot;You shall be holy&quot;) and the
programmatic proclamation of faith voiced by <span class=SpellE>Korach</span>:
&quot;<i>The entire community is holy&quot; -</i><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>i.e., <span class=SpellE>kedusha</span>
is not a goal which Israel is charged to achieve but it already exists
inherently and unconditionally. The great concept of faith - <span
class=SpellE><i>kedusha</i></span> - is profaned and becomes an idolatrous
concept.</p>
