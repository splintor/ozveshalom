<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>In their book &quot;That's
Not What's Written in the Bible&quot;, Yair Zakowitz and Avigdor Shinan present
an interesting argument regarding the beginning of 'Parashat Vayetzeh' - <b>Yaakov's
dream</b>, which ends with Yaakov naming the place where he slept 'Beit El' [House
of God] and setting up his stone pillow as a monument. They claim that the
story is an anti-thesis, a mirror image, of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
narrative in Parashat Noah. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The authors
maintain that the Torah desired to mock the Babylonian belief that the city of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City> was the gate to
heaven, the meeting place of heaven and earth, of gods and men. The original
name of '<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City>'
was 'Bab-Ilu' - Gate of the God'. The Biblical explanation is that the name was
created from the root b'l'l' - 'confusion' - of peoples and tongues. According
to the Biblical narrative, the tower was erected in the heart of the city at
the initiative of men in order to ascend to heaven, abode of the gods. This
version is authenticated by - <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>perhaps
even based upon - the ancient Babylonian story of the city's founding; one year
they burned bricks, the second year they built the tower to the height of the
heavens…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The authors
detail the contrasts through parallelisms. To note a few: In the '<st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City>' story, the
initiative to reach heaven is of human origin. God descends from heaven to
observe the Babylonians' activities, and, as a result, He is angered, and
punishes them. In the 'Jacob's Ladder' story, the initiative for the meeting is
God's. Yaakov lies on the ground, on a low place, and God stands at the head of
the ladder. He does not descend, but sends angels, and subsequently He blesses
Jacob. This and yet more, the people of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City>
used bricks which they created with their own hands; Yaakov takes a stone from
nature, and transforms it into a monument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Through the
contrast between the two stories, our fathers wished to say that the beliefs
and culture of the Babylonians constituted rebellion against God, arrogant
conceit, as compared with the faith of Israel and its culture, the salient
features of which are acceptance of the unbridgeable distance between God and
man, and self-education to humility and modesty in man's standing before his
creator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The Babylonians'
feeling that they were able to reach the habitat of the God in heaven had its
origin primarily in the fact that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City>
was the greatest technological power in the era of the Patriarchs, and its
construction projects were among the wonders of the ancient world. I have no
doubt that modern <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babel</st1:place></st1:City>'s
race to conquer the moon nurtures the contemporary belief that man has the
ability to reach everywhere, and there is nothing he cannot accomplish. It is
only a matter of time and financial investment in research and development, predict
NASA (<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
space agency) personnel, until man-made spaceships will be able to reach even
stars beyond the solar system. On the other hand, approximately once a decade,
a disaster occurs (such as the one in which the Israeli astronaught, Ilan
Ramon, was killed), sending us a reminder that we are but human beings, and
that even at the peak of our technological accomplishments we will not be
immune to error. And more - even though we succeed in lengthening our life
span, we shall still be mortal. Even more - even as we overcome tremendous
technological challenges, we still have great difficulty communicating with
each other because of humanity's profusion of languages, opinions, and cultures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Yaakov is the
antithesis of the Babylonians' (ancient and modern) self-confidence. He
dedicates a simple unchiseled fieldstone to God who appeared to him in a dream.
His modest requests &quot;bread to eat and a garment to wear&quot; show that he
values and appreciates the simple gifts which God gives him daily and hourly,
and that he will educate his progeny not to be swept away by the intoxication
of those who boast &quot;My strength and the power of my arm have produces this
wealth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Yaakov is a
man searching for a place on earth, a tent-dweller and a wanderer who dreams
about building a house for the Lord who appeared to him. The word <i>makom</i>
[location, place] is a keyword in the first chapter of the parasha <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Z. Falk: <i>Divrei Torah ad Tumam</i>, p. 66)</span>.
From &quot;And he came upon a certain <b>place</b>&quot; through &quot;How
fearsome is this <b>place! </b>This can be but the house of God…&quot; All of
the three patriarchs encounter God in the open spaces of nature, in the field
and on the mountain. The Talmud <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Pesahim 88a)</span>
asks: Why will many nations say in the end of days &quot;Come let us go up… to <b>the
house of the God of Yaakov&quot;?</b> Why do they not say <b>to house of the
God of Abraham </b>or <b>those of the God of Yitzchak?</b> The reply is that
Abraham is remembered by virtue of &quot;on the mountain God will be revealed&quot;;
Yitzchak goes to converse with his God in the field, and smells &quot;the
fragrance of the filed which God has blessed&quot;; only Yaakov vows to erect
for his God a '<b>house' - </b>to compress` the divine presence into a manmade
building, which he will build with his own hands… this is his vow and this is
his hope as he sets out on his journey to the unknown. </p>

physical eye can be explained either as a disguise of the angel - as in the
case of Yosef, <i>&quot;and a man discovered him&quot;,</i> meaning that he
dressed in human garb - or as Yaakov having so sensitive an imagination as to
experience actual encounter one with the other. If one approaches his friend,
he is first discerned from afar, and only later is there physical contact. This
not the case with the angel. A human cannot see him from afar; only when he is
nearby is his capacity for (spiritual) perception sufficiently sharpened.
Similarly, our ancients explained <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit
16:13)</span> <i>&quot;Have I actually gone on seeing here after his seeing
me?&quot;</i> - since he (the heavenly messenger) had stopped talking to her,
she could no longer 'see' him [Trans. note - her seeing was a spiritual
experience, in effect as long the angel spoke to her]. Thus, with regard to our
passage: Even though they (the angels) were coming from Eretz Yisrael to meet
him, he did not see them from afar. Only they physically touched him, when they
were actually with him - when he needed them - then he discerned them and his
sight was purified. Therefore it says, <b>&quot;when he saw them&quot; - </b>after
making contact, and not prior to contact, for <i>&quot;This is a camp of
God!&quot;</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>…His is not an encounter between
two humans, but a meeting between Yaakov the man and angels. This is not
something which can be seen, because the angels which man sees are seen in his
consciousness. This seeing of angels is a metaphoric expression of man's inner
cognizance of God, and therefore man sees them only when they are within him,
in his consciousness . . . it should be noted that these ideas are articulated
by Reb Meir Simcha against the background of his knowledge of the Rambam's
doctrine of prophecy, in which &quot;angels&quot; are perceptions of the
imagination.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

correct order; one cannot be in his dwelling place unless he is found in his

he had no land. The land was only a goal, it was a land of the future.
Therefore, it seems, he said: <i>&quot;&quot;u'lartsi&quot;</i>&nbsp;(connoting

God. Rather he did find out and gave chase and caught up with him, but in any

that divine providence will be with them in the path they choose to follow, yet
the Holy One Blessed Be He disrupts their plans in order to cause them distress
and purify them, or for some other reason. In any case, he does save them and
