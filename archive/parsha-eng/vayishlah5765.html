<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Leah's
daughter, Dinah, was born to Jacob after his having fathered ten boys with
three women. Leah had given birth to <span class=SpellE>Zevulun</span>, and his
name expressed both his being a gift as well as her expectation of being
honored by Jacob for having given him six sons. Dinah was born after <span
class=SpellE>Zevulun</span>. Her name is unexplained, and no mention is made of
her serving any role in the wives' contest for Jacob's heart. A short verse
informs us: <i>Afterwards, she gave girth to a daughter and called her Dinah</i>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span> 30:21)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The
second and final episode in which we come across Dinah in the Torah appears in <span
class=SpellE>parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Vayishlah</span>, in chapter
34. The story is about her, but her voice remains unheard. Many relational
epithets are attached to her name in this chapter: <i>Jacob's daughter</i>, <i>maiden</i>,
<i>girl</i>, and <i>sister</i> to her brothers. Dinah never appears as an
independent personality. Her desires and thoughts are never described, leaving
a void to be filled by <span class=SpellE><i>derashot</i></span>. In this short
article, I would like to trace the issue of control and loss of control in
connection with two women who suffered sexual assault, namely, <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Dinah</b> and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Tamar</b>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Dinah
is the girl/maiden who appears as<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i> </i></b><i>Dinah,
the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob</i>, who went out to visit
the daughters of the land. The plain meaning of the text implies that the only
girl in a family of boys longed for the friendship of girls her own age. <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> son of <span class=SpellE>Hamor</span>, son of the
sovereign of the land of the <span class=SpellE>Hivites</span>, takes her and
tries to rape her. If we read carefully, it is clear that she did not consent,
that she froze-up and became thing-like; <i>he <span class=GramE>lay</span> her
by force, hurting her</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(34:2)</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> &quot;lays her&quot; (<span class=SpellE><i>shokhev</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>otah</span></i>) and does not &quot;lay <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>with</b> her&quot; (<span class=SpellE><i>shohkev</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>itah</span></i>). That is how he hurt her - through violent sexual
assault. It seems from the adjoining verses that the attempted rape was broken
off, since it says, <i>Being strongly drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and in
love with the maiden, he spoke to the maiden tenderly</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(34:3)</span>. <span class=SpellE>Shekhem</span>
encounters Dinah's inexperience and lack of understanding of relations between
the sexes. He discovers that Dinah is a maiden/girl. This discovery seems to

father, Jacob, hears that his daughter has been defiled but remains silent
until the <span class=GramE>brothers</span> return from their shepherding. Jacob
has heard a rumor that Dinah has been defiled, i.e., raped. Dinah did not
return home, remaining in <span class=SpellE>Shekhem's</span> house, either
kidnapped, or perhaps of her own free will. (Verse 26 makes it clear that Dinah
had not returned home.) Jacob and the brothers appear as a single party to the
negotiations over <span class=SpellE>Shekhem's</span> request for Dinah's hand,
as is evidenced by the use of the plural possessive, <i>my son <span

well-being, they do not seek to clarify exactly what happened to her, and they
are completely uninterested in what she thinks or wants - she is never asked. The
brothers hold control. They negotiate with an eye towards restoring the family's
good name and obtaining vengeance. <i>Jacob's sons answered <span class=SpellE>Shekhem</span>...

22:28-9 it is written: <i>If a man finds a virgin maiden who was not betrothed,
took her and lay with her... in consequence of his having hurt her, she shall
be his wife, he shall never be able to send her away</i>. The law refers to the
seduction of a virgin maiden, even if the act was consensual - <i>lay with her</i>,
rather than <i>laid her</i>, which we saw by Dinah. Seduction is defined as
harm. It also counts as a violent act, since men are responsible for stopping outbreaks
of fornication. The Torah wants to create an opportunity for the rehabilitation
of the seduced maiden's personal status, for she has undergone harm for which
she may have to pay a weighty price. In a society which holds virginity to be a
necessary requirement for honorable marriage, she may become a deserted woman

force the girl to marry her abductor. The girl is never asked to give her

wants to inspect her virginity. She finds herself forced to marry the abductor,

that happens to the girl reflects the wishes of the family and of the
community. The good of the girl herself - of the only person <span class=GramE>involved</span>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>David's
daughter Tamar, sister to <span class=SpellE>Avshalom</span> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(II Samuel, chapter 13)</span> is described as a
beautiful young virgin who was raped by her brother <span class=SpellE>Amnon</span>
after he developed an obsessive attraction to her. <span class=SpellE>Amnon</span>
is driven to distraction by the thought of her being a sexually unavailable
virgin: <span class=SpellE><i>Amnon</i></span><i> was so distraught because of
his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she was a virgin, and it seemed
impossible for <span class=SpellE>Amnon</span> to do anything to her </i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(verse 2)</span>. Following the advice of <span
class=SpellE>Yehonadav</span>, the son of David's brother <span class=SpellE>Shimah</span>,
he asks his father, &quot;<i>Let Tamar my sister come and prepare a couple of
cakes before me, and let her bring them to me&quot;</i> <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(v. 6)</span>. It is reasonable to assume that David understood <span
class=SpellE>Amnon's</span> inclinations, but could not imagine how terrible
his goals were. In contrast to Dinah, whose voice is not heard, once the
atmosphere of seduction and sexual <span style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>extortion
is established, the book of Samuel has Tamar appear as a full human presence
who is quoted directly. On the one hand, she honors the request of her father
and brother, but on the other hand, she stands up magnificently to <span
class=SpellE>Amnon</span>, speaking with the voice of reason, asking that he
have mercy on them both and suggesting alternatives. But <span class=SpellE>Amnon</span>
<i>would not listen to her; he overpowered her and laid her by force</i> </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(v. 14)</span><span

style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>laying her</span></i></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. She was nothing but a body to
him, not a person enjoying independent will and status. <span class=SpellE>Amnon's</span>
behavior was atrociously violent. Afterwards, he forcibly removed her from his
room, treating her mercilessly despite her pleas. Tamar went screaming. Her
brother <span class=SpellE>Avshalom</span> met her, understood what had
happened, and told her, <i>&quot;For the present, sister, keep quiet about it;
he is your brother. Don't brood over the matter&quot;</i> </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(v. 20)</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, and Tamar kept her silence. The
incident troubled David greatly, and it is reasonable to assume that he did not
believe his son would do such a thing. Tamar is left alone with her trauma - <i>And

she became a forlorn desert. <span class=SpellE>Avshalom</span> took over
control from Tamar, and by asking her to remain silent, he took away her power
and her ability to see to her own security and welfare. He made her entirely
dependent upon him, largely causing her forlornness. <span class=SpellE>Avshalom</span>
was unable to forgive <span class=SpellE>Amnon</span> or to listen to his
sister. Relations within the family are unhealthy following a traumatic event. Two

women who suffer sexual assault keep quiet or are kept quiet about it. They are
left alone with their trauma and their voices are usually not heard. The most
important lesson to be learned from the stories of Dinah and Tamar is that we
must not take control out of the hands of assault victims. Return of control
requires that we develop the ability to listen and act only in accordance with
the women's own <span class=GramE>requests,</span> even if that means that we
must remain quiet and inactive. The victims know what is best for them and how
strong they are. It is therefore important to turn to help centers, and refer
victims to them, in order to benefit from the counseling and help which they offer
both to victims as well as to those close to them. In that way, it will be
possible to restore control to them and create a situation of basic security

his <i>Book of Judges</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Hilkhot</span>
<span class=SpellE>Melakhim</span> 9:14)</span>, saying that &quot;sons of Noah&quot;
are commanded concerning certain laws, and thus they are required to appoint
judges in each and every district to give judgment concerning the six
commandments which are obligatory upon all mankind. &quot;And a <span
class=SpellE>Noahide</span> who transgresses one of them is subject to the
death penalty by the sword. If he sees a person transgressing one of these
seven laws and does not bring him to trial for a capital crime, he who saw him
is subject to the same death-penalty. It was on account of this that the people
of <span class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> had incurred the death-penalty because <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> committed an act of robbery and they saw and knew
of it, but they did not bring him to trial.&quot;</p>

that and punish them by dividing them and scattering them in Israel? Were they
not meritorious, fulfilling a commandment and trusting in God Who saved them?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>In my opinion, the
meaning of the laws which the Rabbis have counted among their seven <span
class=SpellE>Noahide</span> commandments is not just that they are to appoint
judges in each and every district, but He commanded them concerning the laws of
theft, overcharge, wronging, and a hired man's wages; the laws of guardians of
property, forceful violation of a woman, seduction, principles of damage and
wounding a fellowman... And it is also included in this commandment that they
appoint judges for each and every city, just as Israel was commanded to do, but
if they failed to do so they are free of the death-penalty since this is a
positive precept of theirs [and failing to fulfill a positive precept does not
incur the death-penalty]... Moreover, why does the Rabbi [<span class=SpellE>RaMBaM</span>]
have to seek to establish their guilt? Were not the people of <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> and all seven nations idol worshippers,
perpetrators of unclean acts, and practitioners of all things that are
abominable to God<span class=GramE>?...</span> However, it was not the
