21.3pt'>Most of the passages in Parashat Vayakhel dealing with exact descriptions
of the Tabernacle construction are quite uncomplicated, and therefore require
few words of explication. The Tabernacle was made entirely of materials readily
attainable from the Children of Israel themselves (the women's golden ornaments
or the goat wool) or from the desert surroundings (acacia trees, skins of <i>tachash
</i>[suggested translations include &quot;dolphin&quot;, &quot;dugong&quot;, &quot;seal&quot;,
&quot;giraffe&quot;, and &quot;ocher-colored&quot;]). As a rule, the Torah did
not cite the source of the materials employed in the fashioning of the
utensils. For example, it is written that the altar and its utensils were made
of bronze, but we know not what was the source for this bronze. The exception
is the bronze basin adjacent to the altar, which was made of the mirrors that
belonged to the women who gathered near the entrance to the Tent of Appointment:
&quot;And he made the basin of bronze and it is pedestal of bronze with <b>the
mirrors of the <i>tsoveot - </i>[those women who gathered] at the entrance to
the Tent of Appointmen</b>t&quot;. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(38:8). </span>Why
did the Torah specify the fact that the basin and its pedestal were made of
women's mirrors? And what is the meaning of that <b>gathering</b> of the women
whose mirrors were taken for the making of the basin? <span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>[Translator's note: The meaning of <i>hatsoveot</i> is uncertain.

mirrors fall into two main categories: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

facilitate reflection of light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>B. The symbolic - the fact that the basin was made of women's mirrors gave
it symbolic significance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Prof. Admiel Cossman<st1:PersonName w:st="on"><sup>1</sup></st1:PersonName>
presents two explanations which fall into the instrumental category: The first,
offered by the &quot;Yalkut David&quot;, claims that the basin was made of
mirrors so as to serve as a mirror itself, enabling those on the outside the Tabernacle
to view that which was inside. Others explain that that women wanted to witness
the ritual service and the prayers, but were forbidden to mix with the men,
therefore the basin at the entrance to the Tent was made of mirrors, so as to facilitate
viewing within&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Torah Sheleima, P. <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>32)</span><st1:metricconverter ProductID="2. In"
w:st="on"><sup>2</sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>. </span>In</st1:metricconverter>
a similar vein, the Rakanati on Parashat Vayikra writes that the priests could discern,
by means of the basin, the faces of women offering sacrifices, because to look
at them directly was prohibited: &quot;And also, during the sprinkling of the
blood, the priest must see the man and the women for whom the sacrifice atones,
and because it is forbidden to look at a women therefore he made the basin with
the mirrors of the women, because when the priest offers a woman's sacrifice he
looks into the basin and sees the face of the woman who is bringing the sacrifice&quot;.
The purpose of the mirrors in the basin, then, was to &quot;kosherize&quot; priest
and woman looking at each other by means of an intermediary instrument that
reflects the lines of the face but somewhat blurs the exact features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The instrumentalist explanations attribute to the basin the function of
coping with desires which are liable to be aroused during the service of God in
the Tabernacle. It is not mere coincidence that that the phrase &quot;women who
gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment&quot; appears again in the
Bible in the context of those same desires, as the priests and female
supplicants meet at the Tent: &quot;And Eli was very old. When he heard what
his sons were doing to all <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and how they lay with <b>the women who gathered at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting&quot; </b>(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>I Samuel 2:22</span>). The 'women
who gathered' had certainly come for the purpose of serving the Lord, whether
by praying (Onkylos, ibid) or in order to donate of their belongings to the
service in the Tent of Meeting. The semantic similarity between the two quotes
raised a difficult question regarding the instrumental function of the basin
mirrors: The women who gathered at the entrance to the Tent in the times of Eli's
sons were drawn to sin<sup>3</sup>. The sons of Eli exploited their high
position in order to abuse women, and who knows if that was because of that
look which passed by way of the mirrors?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In my opinion, this is the reason that a number of exegetes, led by Rashi,
were driven to exchanging - by way of drash [homiletic exposition] - the plain meaning
of hatsoveot (in the sense of gathering and waiting) for a remote association,
that of fecund fertility:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.35pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:42.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>The daughters
of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
possessed mirrors into which they looked as they decorated themselves, and even
these they did not refrain from contributing to the Tabernacle. Moshe looked
down upon them, because they were created to serve the <i>yester hara - </i>the
evil inclination. Said to him the Holy One, blessed be He: Accept them, because
they are more dear to me than everything, for through them the women gave birth
to <b>many armies in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
[</b>The word <i>tsvaot</i><b> </b>may also be interpreted - and in
contemporary Hebrew is almost exclusively interpreted - as &quot;armies&quot;].
<span lang=HE dir=RTL><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In the commentaries of Rashi (and of Ramban) the waiting women become
women who gave birth to an army of children, and the mirrors played an
important part in this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.35pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:42.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>When their husbands
were fatigued because of heavy labor, they would bring them food and drink and
would feed them and they took along the mirrors, <b>and each saw herself with
her husband in the image and seduced them with speech, saying I am more
pleasant than you</b>, and thereby they aroused passion in their husbands and
they had intercourse with them and they became pregnant [...] and the basin was
made of them, for its purpose was to make peace between man his wife, that she
drink of its waters because he was jealous of his wife and she had secreted herself.
[The reference is to the Sotah ritual. See Bemidbar 5:<st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName><st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>-3<st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Thanks to the joint looking into the mirror the Jewish people were saved
from annihilation. The mirror, like the pictures in a wedding album, made it
possible for the men to see themselves in a committed relationship even within
a difficult reality of servitude and decrees, to maintain intimacy with their
spouses. In other words, according to Rashi, the basin, made of mirrors, symbolized
the commitment to a tie between husband and wife, and that commitment to
continuity will triumph even should jealousy arise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Ibn Ezra also assigns the mirrors symbolic-rather than instrumental-
significance, but in complete contrast to Rashi (who saw the mirrors as factor
which strengthens the marital tie and fecundity), Ibn Ezra turns the basin into
a symbol for abstinence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.35pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:42.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>The rationale
behind the <i>tsoveot </i>[commandment] was that all women are wont to prettify
themselves daily in front of mirrors [...] for the custom of Israel was like
that of Yishmael until this very day. But here we find in Israel God-serving
women who left this world's passionate desires and gave their mirrors as a
donation because they no longer had need for them in order to beautify
themselves. They would come daily to the Tent entrance only to pray and learn
the commandments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The construction of the basin, according to Ibn Era, embeds the mirrors
in a vessel whose form and function are totally different. The women took an
object which assists in the magnification of external beauty and the material
world, and transformed it into a spiritual vessel which prepared the priests
for the service of God. The function of the basin in the creation of a
connection between man and woman does not appear in Ibn Ezra's commentary; in
its stead it emphasizes the basin's basic function of cleansing the priests: &quot;And
you shall make a basin of bronze and its pedestal of bronze for washing... <b>and
Aharon and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet</b> as they enter the
tent of Meeting...&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(30:<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>8-20).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In summation - for most of the exegetes, the use of mirrors for
manufacture of the basin is tied to the physical attraction between man and
woman. The instrumentalist school sees the mirrors as important for the
physical structure of the basin; the symbolist approach understands the mirrors
as alluding to the way in which the basin symbolizes the preservation of
national continuity (Rashi, Ramban and others) or as abstinence from physical
custom (Ibn Ezra).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The passage regarding the gathering women (as well as other passages)
focuses the reader's attention on the centrality of women's contribution to the
building and organization of the Mishkan as a ritual site shared by men and
women. The commentators (male) may differ in their understanding of the women's
devotion and of their influence on the function of the Mishkan's vessels, but
none attempt to belittle the partnership itself and its importance. To our joy,
we, too, live in a generation in which women gather at the entrances to halls
of study and synagogues, and demand to participate in study and prayer.
Unfortunately, rabbis and many public figures still find it difficult to truly
explain women's demand for partnership and recognition. Perhaps a close look in
the mirror can help, as per the suggestion of the <b>Maggid of Mezeritch:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.35pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:42.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>Every person
must look at the other as if he were looking into a mirror; just as the mirror
reflects the looker's ugly aspects, so, when looking at the flaws of another he
should discern them also in himself, and learn from this how to remove them [...]
therefore, when the priests came to wash their hands and their feet prior to
the service, they also had to cleanse themselves of every spiritual flaw, of
every deficiency, personal interest and favor. The basin was made of the
mirrors to remind them that in order to discern their own flaws, they should
look at the other.</p>

Some exegetes argue that the mirrors themselves where hammered into the body of
the basin; others, such as the Ramban, believe that the bronze from which the
mirrors were fashioned was high quality bronze, highly and very beautiful&quot;
with sharp and clear reflection. </p>

Even if we accept the view of most commentators that the women referred to were
not actually guilty of adultery but rather of some lesser sin, the punishment
of Eli's sons for their actions testifies to very problematic behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>I wish to write about <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>
Hartman from a personal point of view. The personal angle differs from the
objective image of the legacy which the man bequeaths: his books which unite
into an corpus of thought, crystallized and developing; the Institute and its
branches he founded; the schools established under his inspiration; the many
and varied students who studied his teachings, whether in acquiescence or in
the disagreement which he so loved and made room for. The personal angle is
that of a halacha-committed Orthodox person who met him, with his surging
persona bursting beyond all routine definitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>David's words found open ears among members of the many identities
which compose the Jewish nation in our time and among many intellectuals beyond
the borders of the Jewish people. It is not coincidental that the walls of the Institute
which he established enclosed secularist, Reform, Conser-vative and Orthodox
Jews, as well as Christians and Moslems. This phenomenon was derived from that
essence which was a reflection of the heart and consciousness of <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>. I am one of many, an Orthodox religious
person who met <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>, and it is
about this meeting and from this point of meeting that I wish to write. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Where I come from, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName> was
perceived as an <i>Acher­- </i>as Elisha ben Abuya, who 'studied and then
abandoned [the Torah]'. A controversy existed among the students of Rav
Soleveietchik, and in the eyes of the group to which I belonged, David was
perceived of as one who had deviated from the framework. But what did I find
when I met him? I found a man who did not deviate from the framework, but who
painted a new picture which extended beyond frameworks. Instead of a picture
fragmented into various Jewish identities in which everyone found himself
within specific boundaries, constantly in conflict with other identities
existing within other boundaries, there stood a man who roared in a voice that
was also known to break into a rolling laugh: &quot;I am a Jew&quot;. The Talmud
says in reference to the words of the Master of the Universe: Said R. Yochanan;
What is the meaning of &quot;The Lord gives a command; the women who bring the
news are a great host&quot;<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> (Psalms 68</span>)?
Every word emanating from the mouth of the All Powerful is divided into seventy
languages. The students of R. Yishmael taught: &quot;And like a hammer that
shatters rock&quot;<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> (Jeremiah 23)</span>. Just
as the hammer bursts into many sparks, so every word which comes from the mouth
of Holy One, blessed be He, divides into seventy languages. Similarly (but with
obvious difference) such an exposition can be applied to the thought of great
teachers. R. Nachman of Breslav, HaRav Kook, HaRav Soleveitchik, Yeshaayahu
Leibowitz: &quot;Each one of these thinkers produced different students, each
interpreting his master's teachings differently from his companion. The
phenomenon is amazing: Two contemplate the teaching of HaRav Kook, one
understands it as emphasizing the exclusivity of the Jewish people and derives
from it the negation of general studies and the application of academic tools
to Jewish sources; the second group derives from these very same teachings a
universal approach which obligates such studies. This phenomenon may be generalized
as follows: A teacher whose thought is complex and multi-faceted, with students
who reveal each one a different aspect of said teaching. Each thinker has a
unique explanation. <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName> Hartman
belonged to this latter group or teachers and thinkers. Words like a hammer
shattering rock, exciting and basic words, reached the ears of various
students, suiting each one. I shall attempt to decipher the unique secret of
this man which brought about this phenomenon, resulting in the fact that one
like myself finds interest and content in his words even as alongside me sit
people very different from myself who also find meaning in the same Torah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>First, as I pointed out, the man experienced from a place in the depths
of his self his overall identity: <b>the Jew.</b> This Jew transcends all the partial
identities - without negating or ignoring them - coalescing with the most
encompassing identity of all: <b>Man.</b> This identity received expression
both in the Jewish sources on which he focused - redeeming them from neglected
corners of the Bible and the Talmud, placing them center stage - and also in
the spontaneous speech which rolled into peaks of affection and nadirs of pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Second, the man brought with him a vibrant tradition which also cracked
the borders of language. He spoke a personal language, unique to himself,
composed of Hebrew, English and Yiddish. This was not only a technical
language; the Yiddish brought with it all the tradition of the Jewish world
from whence he came, the English carried the American democratic values he
brought with him to Israel, the Hebrew expressed all the Zionism embodied in
the act of his <i>aliya</i> to the land which merged in his consciousness with
the entire Zionist phenomenon. Within him the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
was reconstructed, only this time not with a single tongue, but with all the languages
jumbled one with the other. The single tongue led people to pride rising to the
heavens. The mixed tongues led <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>
to a humble and sober position which truly understood that there are many
tongues, many people, and that their unification is essential and that it does
not erase the limitations and the fractures of the single language which
enables embracement of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Third, the man brought with him not only a penetrating intellectual
position, but also much emotion and love of man and love for his brother,
children of his people. It seems to me that this is the reason why his
teaching, when studied by some of his students, takes on an appearance of
academic alienation. Without the existential religious position of love of God
and man - which were expressed by him in his close conversation with the Master
of the universe, similar to that we find with R. Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev - without
this the external cover could seem alienated and incapable of encompassing the
deep religiosity. But the man was not a researcher who studies his subject with
total objectivity. The man was a believer who spoke with God face to face,
intimately. When his cellular would ring in his pocket during a probing and
penetrating statement, he would jump up and say: &quot;Maybe the Ribono shel
Olam is calling to say I've exaggerated&quot;. This was not a stand-up <i>shtick</i>;
it was an expression of a rare experiencing of proximity to God, the likes of
which few - to my personal knowledge - have merited. When a person such as this
marked halachic areas requiring change, the intensity of emotion and the tie to
tradition gave them colors and shadings which permitted even persons with
Orthodox religious identification to listen: &quot;Wounds by a loved one are
long-lasting&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Fourth, the man was blessed with a tremendous sense of humor. Humor is
an important instrument of Jewish traditionalists which got lost in the previous
generation. There is no vessel for holding the absurd like humor, and whoever
has lost his sense of humor - will, in all probability, take simplistic and
one-dimensional positions. The ability to simultaneously hold a living and
stormy religious view and a penetratingly critical secular position is reserved
only for those with a sense of humor. <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>
possessed such a sense of humor, and he shared it generously with his listeners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Fifth, the man was a hedonist of the spirit. The study of Torah and his
occupation with philosophy gave him satisfaction as does a good meal for a <i>bon
vivant</i>. He would smack his lips and gurgle sounds of pleasure when he
quoted a beloved Talmudic reference. A chapter of his book &quot;<span
style='color:black'>A Heart of Many Rooms&quot; bears the title &quot;Celebrating
Religious Diversity&quot;. He celebrated indeed. He strolled through the paths
of the Talmud like Dionysius [god of wine]. Not without reason did he differ
with Yeshaayahu Leibowitz regarding Abraham's defining feature. Leibowitz, like
Kierkegaard, considered the Akeida [the binding of Yitzchak] to be <u>the</u>
expression of Abraham's greatness. <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>
considered the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">high point</st1:place></st1:City>
to be Abraham's challenge to God: &quot;Will not the Judge of all the earth do
justice?!&quot; There are many aspects to this controversy, one of them being: <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName> did not see his Judaism being realized by man's
binding his will, but on the contrary, through the open expression of his full
power and freedom. From this derives a Judaism of joy, not a Judaism of decree
and restriction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='color:black'>All these five points combine into a sense of
the vitality and intense life which pulsated in David's stormy heart. In his
good years - and even in his years of illness - his intensity of life made him
unique. It was possible to disagree with him - and he loved that - and it was
possible even to be angry with him. But it was not possible to remain
indifferent to the storms of his life. He forced his interlocutor to re-examine
the sources of his being which sometimes flicker and are extinguished during
life, and to study anew life and its values, the Judaism which lives within
ourselves. This is how I met the man, and this is how he infused me with new
life, both in spheres of concurrence and in spheres of controversy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
