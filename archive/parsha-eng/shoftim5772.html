to appoint a king - the matter was optional. Yet it is common knowledge that <span
class=SpellE>Chazal</span> considered the appointment of a king to be a
mitzvah! Why, then, does Scripture state &quot;<i>Should you say&quot;?</i> It
would seem that the form of national leadership depends on whether matters are
determined by monarchy or by the will of the people. Some nations cannot bear
monarchial control, whereas for others a state without a king is like a ship
without a captain. This matter cannot be determined by the force of a positive
mitzvah; matters of state leadership touch upon <span class=SpellE><i>sakanat</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>nefashot</span> - </i>life-threatening situations, and
considerations of <span class=SpellE><i>sakanat</i></span><i> <span

appointment of a king as long the general public is not in favor of it, seeing
neighboring nations functioning under a better system... Therefore it is

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Rabbi Yitzchak
<span class=SpellE>Abarbanel's</span> approach in interpreting the chapter on
the monarchy in <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Shoftim</span>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> 17:14-20) </span>is
one of the most famous and innovative of his Torah commentaries (and his ideas
are repeated in his commentary on the Early Prophets). Like many other
commentators, <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span> asks the classic question about
the seeming contradiction between the Torah passages on monarchy (&quot;And you
shall say: I will appoint upon myself a king... you shall indeed appoint upon
yourself a king... etc.&quot;) and what is related in I <span class=SpellE>Shmuel</span>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(8:4-22</span>).when the Children of Israel
request a king, and the prophet initially refuses to accede to their request
and reminds them how heavy will weigh the king's yoke on their necks. What is
unique about <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span> is that this question only
serves as a starting point for a comprehensive and deep discussion of the
preferable form of government, among the nations in general and among the Jews
in particular. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><b>His
conclusion is that no nation needs a king, certainly not the Jewish nation,
whose king is God. </b>Throughout the discussion, the commentator's
intellectual clarity is revealed, along with his deep revulsion at the tyranny
and corruption of rule by one man. Kings, who began to rule &quot;with force
and the stronger overcame&quot;, were supposed &quot;to serve the people, but
they became masters&quot;, and, in general, the monarchy is a &quot;malignant
leprosy&quot; which spread throughout the world. The <st1:PersonName
ProductID="history of the Jewish people" w:st="on">history of the Jewish people</st1:PersonName>
does not present a more positive picture, because the kings &quot;turned the
hearts of the children of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
away&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><b>Alternatively,
R' Yitzchak praises republican rule. </b>He recalls the example of Rome, which,
in his view, reached the peak of its power during its republican period and its
decline was brought about by the Caesars, and also some contemporary examples,
from the political reality of his times: the venerable Venetian republic and
the state of Florence (which enjoyed republican rule for a short period at the
end of 15<sup>th</sup> century, when <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span>
composed his Torah commentary). It is difficult to accept that those republics
were indeed places &quot;with no obstinacy and deviousness, no one raises his
hand against the other nor his foot to any manner of transgression,&quot; as <span
class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span> wrote, but despite the extreme idealization, one
cannot say that the examples are totally arbitrary. Yet more, even without the
examples, the principle is important: R' Yitzchak <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span>
lauds the states ruled by &quot;leaders chosen for set periods&quot; and it is
clear that in his view this is the preferable system of government for man in
general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It is with
good reason that <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel's</span> words are considered a
highly significant source for the world view which combines Torah with
democracy, but it seems that their very radicalism prevented them having real
influence. Few followed in his footsteps to emphasize, when they spoke about
government according to the Torah, the values of liberty and respect for the
will of the majority. Despite this, we do not lack, in later generations,
examples of similar sensitivity to those values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>A commentator
and thinker whose approach is not far from that of <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span>,
and may have been influenced by it, is Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Eliyahu</span> <span
class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Almazog</span>, author of the Torah
commentary &quot;<span class=SpellE>Em</span> <span class=SpellE>LaMikra</span>&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Livorno</span> 1862-3</span>).
A fascinating figure, a modern scholar who was also a mystic with complete
faith in the secret teachings (<span class=SpellE>Kaballa</span>), he served as
rabbi in the community of <span class=SpellE>Livorno</span>, Italy, in the
second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Like <span
class=SpellE>Abarbanel</span> (when he wrote his Torah commentary), R' <span
class=SpellE>Eliyahu</span> Ben <span class=SpellE>Almozag</span> lived in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>, but after <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel's</span>
departure, far-reaching changes in the political reality occurred, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region> and in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>
in general. A new form of rule came into being, one which combined the
institution of the monarchy with liberal and democratic ideals - the
constitutional monarchy. No wonder that the rabbi of <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Livorno</span></st1:place> saw before him not the example of the
Venetian republic, which had ceased to exist, but a form of government close in
spirit and principles to the constitutional monarchy. In his commentary on the
chapter of the monarchy, Ben <span class=SpellE>Almozag</span> emphasizes,
first of all, that the king in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not <b>the source of the law, </b>but rather high commander of the army and
judge, subservient to the law as everyone else. It was particularly the misunderstanding
of this point that was the Israelites' great mistake when they came to request
of <span class=SpellE>Shmuel</span> a king, and because of this <span
class=SpellE>Shmuel</span> reproached them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>[According to the Torah, the king] was in no
way to be a legislator. He was sometimes called <span class=SpellE><i>shofet</i></span><i>
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></i>a judge - who leads them in war,
whether he himself was head of the judges, or this was a figure of speech, and
when Israel asked for a king, had they not added &quot;to judge us like all the
nations&quot; there would have been no fault in this… they did not want a <span
class=SpellE>a</span> head of the army according to Torah law and like some of
the ancient nations, but (they) wanted someone to judge them as is done among
all the nations, <b>that the law be in his hands, free to do as he wishes…</b><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> (</span></b><span class=SpellE><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Em</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> <span
class=SpellE>L'Mikra</span>, <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> 17:8)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The Israelites
in <span class=SpellE>Shmuel's</span> times wanted to appoint over themselves
an absolute ruler, one who could change and warp the law arbitrarily, in total
contrast to the Torah's intent. This is an interesting way to explain the
disparity between the passages in our <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> and the
story in the Book of <span class=SpellE>Shmuel</span>, but in the definition of
the character of monarchy according to the Torah, there is nothing unusual. The
<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>halacha</span></span> expressly
establishes that kings are not above the law and they may themselves be judged
- at least so kings of the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>ic
dynasty (as distinct from the kings of the northern <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Israel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
who may not be judged &quot;because they do not heed the Torah's words&quot; - <span
class=SpellE>Rambam</span>, &quot;<span class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> Torah&quot;,
Laws of Sanhedrim 2:5). Ben <span class=SpellE>Almozag</span> simply assigns
this law a central position, making it the law which expressed the character of
the institution of monarchy in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The
continuation of R' Ben <span class=SpellE>Almozag's</span> commentary, however,
is surprising. He asks the question asked repeatedly since the days of the <span
class=SpellE>Tanaim</span>, whether &quot;<span class=SpellE><i>som</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>tasim</span>&quot; - </i>&quot;you shall surely appoint&quot;
is mandatory or optional, and, in the light of the answer to this question he
attempts to clarify the meaning of the passage: &quot;And you will say: I will
appoint over me a king&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>And the view
of the scribes (=the sages) of blessed memory, is that this is a commandment
and their words are true, for there is nothing with greater potential for good
and for bad as the establishment of or a monarchy, and it is inconceivable that
the Torah would leave it up to man's choice without showing him the proper path
and distancing him from its opposite - and if you should say: Why did Scripture
make [the institution of monarchy] dependent upon [the <span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>      </span>Israelite] saying &quot;I will appoint over myself, etc.&quot;?
I say that the meaning is: Eventually you will <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>say
it, and this comes to teach us that the appointment of a king can be only by
the will of the people, <b>and it is the choice of the people (with the
anointment by God) which gives the power to rule, and lacking this, he is but a
tyrant and rules by force and is not a king.</b> And they, of blessed memory,
had wonderful things to say on this matter, I wonder if they [the wonderful
things] are to be found among sages of the nations and in all their kingdoms in
the times of our Sages, and this is proof that their words came from a
celestial divine source, as follows <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ruth <span
class=SpellE>Rabba</span> 5:6)</span>: All those six months in which <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName> was fleeing Absalom were not counted as years
of his reign, because he achieved atonement by [sacrificing] a she-goat like a commoner
(that is to say, <b>he was not considered to be a king, but </b>just a commoner
who offers a she-goat to atone for unintentional transgression)&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid. <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> 17:14).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It is
worthwhile to compare the above to the words of the <span class=SpellE>Netziv</span>
in his &quot;<span class=SpellE>Haamek</span> <span class=SpellE>Davar</span>&quot;
which was published a few years after &quot;<span class=SpellE>Em</span> <span
class=SpellE>L'Mikrah</span>&quot;. The <span class=SpellE>Netziv</span>, too,
wonders about the meaning of &quot;and you will say 'I will appoint over myself
a king'&quot;, and he, too, explains it as implying that the appointment of a
king is somehow contingent upon &quot;the consensus of the people&quot; (in his
words), but that this agreement is expressed in a different way. In the <span
class=SpellE>Netziv's</span> view, for one nation it is good to be led &quot;by
the view of the people and their elected&quot; and another nation &quot;without
a king is like a ship without a captain&quot;. The Torah left the choice of system
of rule in the hands of the people, since the leadership of the people is a
matter of life and death, and it is impossible to force upon a nation and form
of govern-<span class=SpellE>ment</span> which is not suitable for it.
Therefore, in his view, paradoxically, the nation can choose (as has happened -
and may yet happen) a &quot;strong&quot; government which will limit its
freedoms and save it he need and bother to choose again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In contrast to
the words of the <span class=SpellE>Netziv</span>, it seems that for R' Ben <span
class=SpellE>Almazog</span> there is no choice of form of rule: The Torah wants
Israel to ruled by a king, but this king is explicitly a constitutional
monarch, he must rule with the people's consent, from the will of the people he
derives all his legitimacy. </p>
