<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>God
decides to join the Balak-Balaam game, to give it leverage and to exploit the
opportunity to achieve theological and political ends by transforming the curse
into a blessing. The theological goal - to enhance His name among the nations
of the world as Supreme Power, God of righteousness and justice, omnipotent and
exclusive Lord of truth, impervious to magical influence. The political goal -
to implant fear and trepidation of Israel in the hearts of the region's
nations, to further the rights of the Israelite nation as a member of family of
nations, one with leadership functions, as a moral nation which cannot be
defeated because of the covenant between God and His people, and to reinforce
its indisputable territorial rights to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Canaan</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
as realization of the covenant. If these messages emanate from the mouth of one
considered by the nations to possess the greatest ability to influence
supernatural forces, they will receive authoritative approval and none will
protest.<sup>1</sup> Balak, from his perspective, thought that he had the
political and economic prowess to enlist all the forces necessary for the
struggle, and Balaam believed that he held the necessary power. The region's
nations also thought - or at least hoped - so. This, then, presented a golden
opportunity to reveal to all the nations the identity of the Lord, to win
recognition of God and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>,
and to reinforce the knowledge that as long as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> keeps the covenant, no power
on earth can overcome it or prevent it from settling in its land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpLast style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Among
the blessings with which Balaam blessed the Israelites at God's command is the
blessing &quot;Look, a people that dwells apart, amongst nations it does not
need to come-to-reckoning&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(23:9). </span>Some
interpret this blessing as buttressing the approach which espouses boastful
isolation, disrespect for the values and opinions of other nations, and giving
them no consideration. It does not seem, however, that this is the intent of
the blessing. If, as I have demonstrated, there is importance to the nations'
recognition of the Israelite people and its reception into the family of
nations, then there is, it would seem, a different intent behind the blessing. It
seems to me that according to the plain understanding of the text, Balaam's
intent was to proclaim that the Israelite people, contrary to all other nations
which are ruled over by various earthbound forces, is not subject to magic; it
cannot be defeated with curses, because its Lord is God, who leads on the paths
of morality, righteousness and truth. It is also intended to note that as long
as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
maintains its part of the covenant, it will dwell in security in its uniqueness
and will not be subject to negative influences of other nations. From this we
can deduce that the influence is two-directional. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> is unique as the Lord's
firstborn, sent by Him to humanity to instruct it in monotheistic morality
according to which all powers are subservient to God. Therefore <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
is obligated to preserve this exceptionality throughout history, exceptionality
expressed through the observance of the commandments (not through singular
inherent superiority), which differentiates between us and other nations, and which
prevents us from straying from the good and straight path. The blessing is that
this uniqueness be preserved, and that when the nations will be numbered according
to their cultures and languages, the Israelite nation will be not counted along
with them but separately, as befits their eldest brother who preceded them with
its spirituality and its morality and its responsibility for elevating them to
its level as quickly as possible. The word &quot;<i>yitchashav&quot;</i> is not
to be understood in its usual usage as &quot;taken into consideration&quot;,
but in the sense of &quot;reckoning&quot;. Indeed, until this day the nations
see us, the Jews, as a special nation; they demand of us - who pride ourselves
as being guides for humanity - ethical and spiritual demands they dare not make
of any other nation, and that which they forbid us they permit themselves and
others. If only we can live up to these expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='text-align:justify'><b><i>The Lord opened
the mouth of the she-donkey</i></b><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>-
to speak, since Scripture often alludes to speech and the pronouncing of
letters with the term<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>mouth</i>,
as in<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>who gave man a mouth</i>,
and Moses said,<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>for I am heavy
of mouth and heavy of tongue</i>. Here too, God granted the she-donkey's mouth
the power to pronounce the letters, but it should not be said that the
she-donkey gained a human-like spirit of intelligence. God forbid one think
that way; that is why she did not make any mention of the angel of the Lord who
stood before her, for she lacked the intelligence to make an argument defending
her stubbornness as having resulted from her having seen the angel. Rather, she
spoke like any animal prone to anger that was upset at having been hit. This
miracle occurred in order to cast down Balaam's pride and humiliate him before
the Moabite ministers who accompanied him. Instead of glorying before them in
his wisdom and prophesying, he is now reproved by an animal that has made an
unanswerable argument against him. He had to admit she was right, and there is
no greater humiliation for such an arrogant man. The miracle also paralleled
his sin and crime, for he wanted to find fault with the holy seed and the
chosen elect, and this impure beast found fault with him as if she were his
better. He came to sin with his tongue against the intentions of the Creator
Who granted man the power of speech to use for good and not for evil, and the
she-donkey, who could not speak by nature, spoke more correctly than him in
order to shame him so that he might learn a lesson.</p>
