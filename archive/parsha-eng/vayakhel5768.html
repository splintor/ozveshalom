the <span class=SpellE>Gaon</span> who responded with perfect answers to the
Sadducees who prohibit lamps on the <span class=GramE>Sabbath.</span> Once, one
of them encountered me. I told him we should leave aside the rabbinical
tradition and pursue the Scriptural text alone. He was elated, so I asked him: &quot;Who
says that it is prohibited to light a lamp on the night of the Sabbath after
sunset?&quot; He answered: &quot;</span><i>You shall not kindle fire</i>.&quot;
I responded saying that Scripture only mentions the <b>day</b>. And similarly: <i><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>And on the eighth <b>day</b>, the flesh of
his foreskin shall be circumcised</span></i><span style='mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(<span
class=SpellE>Vayikra</span> 12:3)</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>,
but he cannot be circumcised at night! He answered: <i>A</i></span><i>nd it was
evening and it was morning, one day</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bereishit</span> 1:5)</span> - the two together are called a day,
and the evening preceded the morning. Again I answered that that could not be,
because Scripture says: <i>And God called the <b>light day</b> </i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid)</span>. How could it contradict itself by
calling both darkness and light &quot;day&quot;? And then I explained: it is
written: <i>night and day</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(I Kings 8:49)</span>;
and <i>day and night </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>
8:22)</span>; <i>three days, night and day </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Esther
4:16)</span>; <i>three days and three nights</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Jonah
2:1)</span>. He answered: <i>From evening to evening, you shall observe <a
name="OLE_LINK2">your rest day</a></i><span style='mso-bookmark:OLE_LINK2'> </span><span
style='mso-bookmark:OLE_LINK2'></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Vayikra</span> 23:32)</span>. I again answered, saying that the
verse refers <b>only to Yom Kippur</b>. The proof is that it says <b><i>your
rest day</i></b> - in the singular, instead of [the plural] <i>your rest <b>days</b></i>
as in the verse <i>and observe My rest days</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Vayikra</span> 19:30)</span>... then the Sadducee became confused...
he returned a month later, all happy and self-satisfied, since he had found
[the verse]: <b><i>This day</i></b><i> is a day of good news </i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(II Kings 7:9)</span>. There it is also written: <i>If
we wait until daybreak [we will incur guilt]</i> (ibid) [implying that he spoke
at night but used the word &quot;day&quot;]. So I answered him: &quot;So this
is the only mention of &quot;<i>day</i>&quot;? Is it not written in the Torah: <i>On
the day I struck every firstborn</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bamidbar</span> 3:13)</span> - and the killing of the firstborn
occurred at <b>midnight</b>! Rather, the word &quot;day&quot; can be understood
in two different ways. One refers to day and night, while the other refers to a
particular moment in time, such as, <i>and it shall be in <b>that day</b></i><b>
</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Isaiah 17:4)</span>. And similarly: <i>This
<b>day</b> you cross the Jordan</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Devarim</span> 9:1)</span>. I mention these things so that a
discerning person will be able to interpret Scripture to find various meanings.
That is why we are in need of the accepted interpretations, the tradition and
the Oral Torah in connection with [interpretation of] all of the commandments,
as I have begun to do in this book.</p>

in the world. <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Ki-Tissa</span>
describes the Sin of the Golden calf. Beginning with the Sages, various
interpreters have dealt with the problem of the chronological order of these
events. That is to say: does the order in which the passages appear in the
Torah reflect the chronological order of events, or, as <span class=SpellE><i>Midrash</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>Tanhuma</span></i> teaches, does the Tabernacle come

any of it on an alien shall be cut off from his people.</p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The selection of spices and quantities: 500
shekel of pure myrrh, 250 shekel of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant
cane, 500 shekel of cassia. All told we have a sum of 1500 shekel, which equals
3,000 half-shekels. The beginning of <span class=SpellE>parashat</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ki-Tissa</span> (which we also read as <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span>
<span class=SpellE>Shkalim</span>, this year together with <span class=SpellE>parashat</span>
<span class=SpellE>Pekudei</span>) emphasizes that the half-shekel is intended
to <i>atone for your souls</i>. For what sin does the half-shekel atone? If the
sin of the Golden Calf preceded the construction of the Tabernacle, we it may
be assumed that the 3,000 half-shekels given by 3,000 Israelites who sinned
with the Calf and who were killed by the Levites constitute an atonement for
that sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>1,500 shekel is a huge quantity of spices,
and the commentators disagree regarding the precise combination of those spices
that must be mixed with olive oil to produce <i>oil of holy anointment</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>It would seem that pure olive oil would
suffice for the anointment of the Tabernacle and of Aaron the Priest. The
incense was not needed in order to insure that Aaron and the Tabernacle would
smell good; rather, <b><i>holy</i></b><i> anointment</i> creates holiness,
i.e., difference and separateness (<i>You shall be holy</i> - you shall be
separated). The oil's purity and the complexity of the incense, which was made
from a variety of plants and materials - some better and some worse <span
class=GramE>-</span> reflect the People Israel in its entirety, just as the <span
class=SpellE>midrashim</span> explain in regard to the four species. There is
danger in the holy: <i>Any person who compounds anything like it or puts any of
it on an alien shall be cut off from his people</i>. It exists at the limit, at
the crossing-point. It contains and separates. The Kabalistic &quot;Tree of <span

<span class=SpellE><i>Ohaliav</i></span> - his Father in Heaven is his tent -
the Tent of Meeting. The role of the Tabernacle's architects, <span
class=SpellE>Betzalel</span> and <span class=SpellE>Ohaliav</span>, is to
create the place that links heaven and earth, on the earth and within it, as
symbolized by the plants that were mixed into the oil of holy anointment - top,
stem, and roots. </p>

son of <span class=SpellE>Ahisamakh</span> [&quot;my brother supported&quot;]. Perhaps
he was so named to commemorate the difficult fraternal reconciliation reached
by Joseph and his brothers; perhaps the additional and even chief function of
the Tent of Meeting (stationed in the center of the camp) and of the
half-shekel gift is to bind the Israelites together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;

separateness are best expressed by the bronze basin. R. <span class=SpellE>Meir</span>

about the basin in his commentary, <span class=SpellE><i>Meshekh</i></span><i> <span

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><b><i>They made the bronze basin... from the
mirrors of the women who stood</i></b> - In the <b>command</b> it is written: <i>And
you shall make the bronze basin <b>for washing</b> and you shall place water in
it</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 30:18)</span>,
but there is no mention of <b><i>washing</i> </b>in the description of the
execution of the command. Only in <span class=SpellE>Pekudei</span> is it
written <i>and he placed water in it for washing</i> <span style='font-size:

<span class=SpellE>Tanhuma</span> later cited by <span class=SpellE>Rashi</span>,
that Moses did not want to make it out of the women's mirrors and the blessed
Lord told him that he should make it from them, that they were the means of the
Israelites' being fruitful and multiplying and [the women's] being like gardens
locked up for their husbands. That is why the <span class=SpellE><i>sotot</i></span>
[women suspected of adultery] would drink from the basin and they would be
cleared and would become pregnant. If so, He revealed to him that the water
would also be for the <span class=SpellE><i>sotot</i></span> to drink; not only
for washing, but also for drinking, and that is why he did not write <i>for
washing</i> here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>We again find the principle of binding and
separation in its most human and touching form. The author of <span
class=SpellE><i>Tekhaelet</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Moredekhai</span></i>
<span class=GramE>adds</span>: &quot;It is not enough that the daughters of
Israel offer such contributions - they designate that the mirrors be used
solely for the construction of the basin. From there, from these mirrors of the
evil inclination, the priests will sanctify their hands and feet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The basin is the only artifact in the
Tabernacle - besides the Menorah - for which no measurements are given. It is
thought to have been circular, but the Torah itself gives no explicit indication
of its shape. People who try to reconstruct the details of the Tabernacle
assume that it was circular because none of its measurements are given by the
Torah. The word &quot;circular&quot; [<span class=SpellE><i>agol</i></span>]
appears nowhere in connection with the Tabernacle or indeed anywhere else n the
Torah. If it were not for the written statements of Scripture, we could imagine
a circular Tabernacle, a circular altar, a circular Ark, and a circular table,
and we could invent beautiful explanations about that perfect shape...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>However, as is well known, reality is
different. The Tabernacle is entirely constructed from lines, angles, height,
width, breadth, and especially directions, beginning and end, similar to the
incense in the <i>oil of holy anointment</i>: flowers, stalks, and roots. And
just as we find in the Sabbath: reception of the Sabbath with lamp oil, the
first Kiddush with spiced wine, marking off, binding together, directionality -
so too is the history of the People Israel: from exile to crystallization,
wilderness to exaltedness, independence to service of God. And if independence
fails as it did fail, we are granted a second cycle and a third cycle, this
last one perhaps pointing to the final redemption, since it was the cruelest
exile in the most trying desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>When Moses went up to heaven, our ancestors
had just witnessed the splitting of the Red Sea, the victory over <span
class=SpellE>Amalek</span>, and the <span class=SpellE>theophany</span> at
Mount Sinai, where they heard the &quot;direct&quot; speech of God, making them
ready to enter the Land of Israel. However, they lost their patience and wanted
&quot;Moses Now,&quot; &quot;Israel Now,&quot; and &quot;Comfortable Life-Style
Now.&quot; In a certain sense, they had lost their faith in God but not their
need for some god or another. Therefore, it was only natural that they asked
Aaron, the man closest to Moses, who was the man closest to God, to <i>get up
and make us a god!</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>This is a legitimate request when coming from
the mouths of an enslaved nation, a nation crippled by a lack of faith in the
ability of human beings to confront their fate and the difficulties of the
wilderness on their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Aaron returned them to the event that had
just transpired and which still echoed throughout the world. He returned them
to the <span class=SpellE>theophany</span> at Mount Sinai, where they <i>saw
the sounds</i>; he directs them towards their ears and their wives' and
children's ears - those same ears which had heard Torah directly from God. He
asked them to detach themselves from schemes [<span class=SpellE><i>mimizimot</i></span>],
from <i>the schemes of their ears</i> [<span class=SpellE><i>nimzei</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>ozneikhem</span></i> - usually understood as <i>the rings in
your ears</i>] and they understood it in literal, tangible terms. It was from
those <span class=SpellE><i>nimzei</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>oznayim</span></i>
that the calf was formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The Sages disagree regarding Aaron's role in
the sculpting of the Calf. Did Aaron actually choose to give it the shape of a
calf, or did the wizards from among the mixed multitude - and not the
Israelites proper - bewitch the lump of gold, making it take the form of a
calf? The latter view explains why the verse reads, <i>these are <b>your gods</b>,
o Israel</i> rather than these <i>are <b>our gods</b></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>What could be created from <span
class=SpellE><i>nimzei</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>oznayim</span></i>,
which are <span class=SpellE><i>agilim</i></span> [earrings], if not an <span
class=SpellE><i>egel</i></span> [calf]? Not a circle [<span class=SpellE><i>igul</i></span>]
as a set form, but rather a calf as the making of a circle, and a circle dance
[<span class=SpellE><i>ma'agal</i></span>] - <i>the calf and the dancing</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>That is what emerged from the furnace into
which Aaron threw the gold earrings: a circular form and a circle dance. I can
imagine to myself a ball that is spherical but not a number [<span
class=SpellE><i>sifra</i></span>], the complete opposite of the Tabernacle - a
ball closed within itself, without direction, without connection between
interior and exterior, without a Tent of Meeting, without a process, a
deviation from the path. That is why the Israelites had to drink the water into
which the ashes of the Calf had been thrown. They were like a woman who has
deviated [<span class=SpellE><i>sota</i></span>– more specifically, a woman
suspected of adultery] from her role and loyalties, who also has to drink of
the bitter waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>According to some commentators, the Calf
received its shape accidentally within the furnace, as Aaron <span class=GramE>said,</span>
<i>I threw it in the fire, and out came this calf. </i>In the <span
class=SpellE><i>Tokhaha</i></span> [speech of warning and rebuke] it says: <i>If
you treat <span class=GramE>Me</span> as happenstance... I shall angrily treat
you as happenstance</i>. Happenstance, the circle in which every point is
equivalent to the others, is entirely a matter of coincidence and randomness. Randomness
is the complete opposite of <span class=SpellE><i>tikkun</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>olam</span></i> [mending the world]. It opposes the ability of the
People Israel to engage in <span class=SpellE><i>tikkun</i></span>, and it
opposes the opportunity for <span class=SpellE><i>tikkun</i></span> offered by
the Tabernacle, which represents God's presence in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The Calf is called <span class=SpellE><i>Egel</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>HaZahav</span></i> [literally: &quot;calf of the gold&quot;].
It is not called <span class=SpellE><i>Egel</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>shel</span>
<span class=SpellE>Zahav</span></i> [&quot;calf of gold&quot;]. Gold is Torah. When
Torah is contained in a circle [<span class=SpellE><i>igul</i></span>], the
Torah becomes closed-up, belonging only to individuals who close themselves up
in their own closed circles. Such a Torah is neither studied nor interpreted. That
calf is a <span class=SpellE><i>masekha</i></span> [molten-image or mask], as
we read in Psalms (106:19): <i>And they made a calf at <span class=SpellE>Horev</span>,
they bowed before a <span class=SpellE>masekha</span></i>. This Torah made &quot;circular&quot;
is closed in on <span class=GramE>itself,</span> it hides its face behind a
mask [<span class=SpellE><i>masekha</i></span>]. That mask is different from
the veil worn by Moses. Moses donned a veil to protect those who saw him; the
mask protects the one hiding behind it from showing his true face. A mask
deceives, and so does the Calf: the grand deception continues unto this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>In contrast to the mask, Moses' veil protects
the onlooker, <i>for the skin of Moses' face beamed [with light]</i>. The veil
invites the onlooker and draws him near. While the mask blocks, the veil
filters and draws near.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The Sages find a connection between the
Golden Calf and the Red Heifer: &quot;Let the mother [heifer] come and clean up
its child's [the Calf's] excrement.&quot; A kid and its mothers' milk is the
archetype for the prohibition of mixing milk and meat. <span class=SpellE>Rashi</span>,
following the Sages, writes: &quot;The calf and the lamb are included under the
rubric of ‘kid'; ‘kid' is just a term for ‘offspring.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>For our culture - in contrast to cultures
such as that of India - both the flesh and the milk of the cow are dietary
staples. Judging from the sacrificial rite, we may conclude that cattle and <span
class=SpellE><i>tzon</i></span> [sheep and goats] &quot;starred&quot; a more or
less equally in the lifestyle of our ancestors in the wilderness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The kid and the calf symbolize the complete
opposite of Israel's destiny as it was presented in the <i>Brit <span
class=SpellE>ben</span> <span class=SpellE>Habetarim</span></i> [&quot;Covenant
of the Severed Pieces&quot;]. Israel's destiny is enduring and directed towards
<span class=SpellE><i>tikkun</i></span> and the Messianic Age. In contrast, the
calf and the kid together constitute the &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot;
happenstance. They also stand in contrast to the cow [<span class=SpellE><i>para</i></span>],
which symbolizes fertility [<span class=SpellE><i>poriyut</i></span>]. The &quot;mother&quot;
of every kid or calf does not merely symbolize, but rather actually constitutes
continuity and directionality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>After Moses prays and God is appeased, the
Holy One blessed <span class=GramE>be</span> He does not want to take any
additional risks with the Israelites, the <i>stiff-necked people</i> who had
lost their finery which they had received at <span class=SpellE>Horev</span>,
so He speeds them on their way to Canaan. He destroys the Amorites and the
other nations which had caused the Israelites to pass time in the wilderness
and He gives the Israelites a number of commandments that would be essential
for beginning their new lives in their own land: the destruction of idolatry,
the organization of time and space, and no less important - the strengthening
of Moses' position as leader, together with Joshua, so as not to leave the
Israelites in the circle of the wilderness, but rather to direct them towards
positive activity in their land. All of this was cut short by the Sin of the
Spies, which overturned everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Facing, on the one hand, the danger of the
Spies' call for a return to enslavement and defeat in Egypt, and the
possibility of using the Tabernacle to fortify the people in the wilderness on
the other, God chose to allow the Israelites to contend with the wilderness and
holiness that the Tabernacle engraved into their memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>In conclusion: these events offer an
encounter with two worldviews, two paths. The first is represented by the
Tabernacle, with its precise details, its measurements, <span class=GramE>its</span>
lawfulness. This lawfulness is thrust upon it in the manner of the expression &quot;When
you see it like this, sanctify it&quot; when the &quot;this&quot; refers both
to that which is seen and He who points it out. The other, more natural, path
is represented by the Calf. It is the way of happenstance, <span class=SpellE>cyclicalness</span>,
and primitive drives, described by the Torah in the verse, <i>and they ate and
drank, and got up to carouse</i>.</p>
