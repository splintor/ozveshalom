distance nor to bring close, but to separate those forcibly connected and to
unite those forcibly separated. The House of Zerifa was on the other side of

teaching from the Mishna in Tractate Eduyot and explains their intent by adding
a single word: 'to make peace in the <b>entire </b>world'; that is to say, in
contrast to those Tannaim who thought that Elijah the Prophet's mission is to
bring peace between fathers and sons, to settle disputes <b>within the Jewish
people</b>, the intent of the Sages, in their emphasis upon 'the world', is the
making of peace and spreading it not only within the people of Israel, but

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The hardening
of Pharaoh's heart has a long history, and Biblical exegetes and thinkers
sought to cope with the difficulty inherent in the punishment of Pharaoh and
Egyptian people when, in actuality, they were denied free choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Nechama
Leibowitz <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Studies in the Book of Shemot p.110)</span>
brings all the passages relating to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, and
differentiates (following the Midrash Tanhuma) between the Torah's description
of the hardening of the heart in the first five plagues and that of the later
plagues, and thus writes the Tanchuma: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><i>And he
hardened the heart of Pharaoh - </i></b>In the first plagues it is only written
&quot;<i>And He hardened the heart of Pharaoh</i>&quot;. Because five plagues
had been inflicted yet he did not send [the people off], the Holy One, blessed
be He said, From here on if he wants to send, I do not accept [his wishes], for
so is it written in the latter five plagues &quot;<b><i>And the Lord hardened
the heart of Pharaoh</i></b>&quot;<b><i>, </i></b>and Moshe would decree and
the Holy One would fulfill, as is written &quot;<i>You will decree and it will
be fulfilled&quot; </i>(<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Job 22:28).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Biblical

problem: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:36.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><b><i>For I
have hardened his heart&quot; - </i></b>Said R. Yochanan: This enabled the
heretics to claim that he was prevented from repenting, for it is written &quot;<b><i>For
I have hardened his heart&quot;</i></b>. Replied Resh Lakish: &quot;<i>At
scoffers He scoffs&quot; </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Proverbs 3:34) </span>,
for the Holy One warns a person once and twice and a third time and he does
repent, so He locks his heart against repentance in order to repay him for his
sins, and so with Pharaoh the wicked, because five times the Holy One sent
warnings and five times he ignored them, said the Holy One: You have stiffened
your neck and hardened your heart, I now add impurity to your impurity, thus : &quot;<b><i>For
I have hardened his heart&quot;. </i></b>What is the meaning of <i>hichbadeti </i>[&quot;I
have hardened&quot;]<i>? </i>[The root of <i>hichbadeti - k'v'd' - </i>&quot;heavy:<i>
- </i>also means &quot;liver&quot;]. The Holy One made his heart like liver
which, when cooked a second time, <i>artesis </i>enters into it, so Pharaoh's heart
became like that liver and did not receive the words of the Holy One, thus &quot;<i>For
I have hardened his heart</i><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot; </span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot Rabba 13:3)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Nechama
Leibowitz quotes SHaDaL <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(R. Shmuel David Luzzato, Italy, 19<sup>th</sup> cent):</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:36.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>One may explain
according to the opinion of Rambeman (Mendelssohn) that there was no divine
punishment nor actual miracle. Rather Pharaoh hardened his heart by himself,
yet all actions are ascribed to the Lord in that He is the first cause; and I
add that the acts ascribed in the Bible to the Lord are <b>those unusual phenomena
we do not understand, </b>and so here, <b>Pharaoh's obstinacy even after witnessing
omens and wonders is something strange and puzzling, therefore it is attributed
to the Lord; similar to this is &quot;</b><i>Yet to this day the Lord has not
given you a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear&quot; </i>(<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Devarim 29:3</span>), and also <i>&quot;For the Lord
told , curse David&quot; </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(II Shmuel 16:10).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Other
commentators (R. Yosef Albo, Seforno, Reggio) claim that actually Pharaoh's
reaction to the plagues and his willingness to free the Children of Israel were
not a matter of choice, but rather submission to pressure applied upon him and
therefore - in the long run - freedom of choice was returned to Pharaoh through
the hardening of his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Rambam deals
with the philosophical-theological aspect of the subject of freedom of choice and
problems arising in the Bible, among them the hardening of Pharaoh's heart by
God. Following the basic argument that that prevention of the possibility of repentance
is the severest of punishments, Rambam relates to various examples which would
seem to contradict the principle of free choice:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:36.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>One concludes
from this that the Lord did not force Pharaoh to harm Israel nor did He force Sihon to sin inside his land, nor Israel to worship idolatrously, but all
sinned of their own volition and all were punished by being denied repentance. <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Mishneh Torah of Rambam, Laws of Repentance 6:3)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In other
words, God's hardening of Pharaoh's heart is explained as a punishment which
prevents the possibility of repentance (Resh Lakish and Rambam); as an act of
God, because everything is an act of god inasmuch as He is the First Cause; or
as divine intervention which actually returns to Pharaoh the possibility of
realization his will, i.e., Pharaoh's original hardheartedness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It seems to me
that these various explanations invite us to study the subject of choice and
hardening of the heart not only in the context of Pharaoh, but in relation to
every man, every leader, and every nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In the Shemot
Rabba midrash quoted above, the teacher describes the &quot;hardening of the
heart&quot;:&quot;<b> The Holy One made his heart like liver which, when cooked
a second time, <i>artesis </i>(a property of copper) enters into it&quot;, </b>that
is to say, the heart becomes sealed and impenetrable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The heart is
sealed and impenetrable, it certainly cannot be attentive to the suffering of
the other, and then the question arises: How does a heart become sealed off? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>I think that
the Torah, beginning with Parashat Shemot supplies a convincing description of
the development of this phenomenon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>The frightening of the nation by presenting the stranger as a
demographic and security danger. At the beginning this may have been a calculated
act of demagoguery on the part of the ruler to unite the nation against an
external enemy, but in time the leader himself begins to believe his own
propaganda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>We can assume that the leader does indeed begin to believe that the
strangers constitute a danger and that a way must be found to eliminate them,
for he orders a campaign of male infanticide. According to the midrash, this is
motivated also by a real fear of the birth of a leader who will foment
revolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>When Moshe and Aharon first appeal to Pharaoh and he rejects their
request to worship their God, the Torah does not specifically refer to &quot;hardening
of the heart&quot;. It may be that Pharaoh feels that the current state of
servitude is sustainable, so why attempt to change a situation prevalent for
years. After all, the aliens seem to have reconciled themselves to their
condition, so why permit them something which they themselves did not request
and which may upset a functioning equilibrium? They have become accustomed to
the situation! In other words, the first stage in the hardening of the heart is
the belief that it is possible to enslave another nation forever, and therefore
it is also necessary to suppress attempts, even limited ones, at developing
self-identity (such as observance of a different religion).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>d.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>'Hardening of the heart' first appears explicitly following the plague
of the frogs. Pharaoh promises that in return for removal of the frogs, he will
permit the Hebrews performance of the desert ritual as Moshe requested, but
then he breaks his promise. Does he intuit that temporary release of the slaves
will lead to their escape? In any case, the second stage in the hardening of
the heart is perhaps the belief that the ruler has no commitment to his alien
slaves; he rules with absolute power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>e.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>In the ensuing plagues, e.g. following the plague of the swarm of wild
beasts [&quot;<i>arov&quot;</i>], Pharaoh seems to soften up, he does lighten
control; he suggests that they observe the ritual within the land of Egypt or somewhere nearby, but again he retracts. The hardening of the heart is the
need to control and the denial of choice and freedom for others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>f.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span dir=LTR>The first time where there is divine intervention is after
the plague of boils; here perhaps the heart has already hardened and is totally
impenetrable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It may well
be, then, that the Torah is teaching us an essential lesson on choice; a
leader, any man, or any nation, in a slow and incremental process such as the
stages described above, can harden and seal his/its heart and be opaque to the
needs and suffering of the other.. At some point, this imperviousness becomes
irreversible, and even the most severe plagues cannot effect change. Denial of
choice to one who rules over others parallels, in a certain sense, the attempt
of the leader to deny the right of choice of others, and the sad poetic justice
decrees that the enslaver himself becomes slave to his own imperviousness; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It seems to me
that the Torah's goal is not only to inform us of what happened to Pharaoh and
the Egyptian people, but also - perhaps primarily - to warn every man, every
nation, including ourselves, in these times, what are the dangerous
ramifications of sealing off the heart.</p>

the nature of darkness to so imprison someone that he cannot get up from where

so long that they would have died from thirst and hunger if the Israelites did
not come to help&nbsp;them,&nbsp;feeding them and giving them drink. Thus it
seems reasonable that they did this, and Scripture&nbsp;alludes&nbsp;to it the
later verses; when the Egyptians saw the Israelites repaying evil with good,
they lost their hatred of them and began to honor and love them, and to believe
that they had a divine quality. That is why they generously lent things to them
and showed them favor. They also greatly honored Moses, which they had not done
previously.</span></p>

us the secret of the matter - that there was no darkness in the land, but&nbsp;<b>only
in the eyes of the Egyptians</b>. Therefore, the Israelites had light - even
those who lived in close proximity to the Egyptians. That is the significance
of [the expression]&nbsp;<b><i>in their dwellings</i></b>: the expression
refers to the Egyptians - even in the Egyptian dwellings and their vicinity
they [the Israelites] saw light, while there was darkness in the&nbsp;land&nbsp;of&nbsp;Goshen because many Egyptians lived in the&nbsp;land&nbsp;of&nbsp;Goshen&nbsp;amidst the Israelites, and they were also punished. There was no place where an

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0pt'>On
the Pesach in Egypt the<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>hametz<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>prohibition lasted only one day.
The Sages further taught us that the first Pesach was not considered a Yom Tov
(no commandment to rejoice, as on other festival days). In my opinion, the
reason for giving - at that time -- other<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>mitzvot</i><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>valid for generations to come, is to
teach the perfection of His commandments. In all other nations, a day of
victory over enemies is celebrated as a Victory Day. Such is not the case with Israel; they do not rejoice at the fall their enemies, and they will not joyfully
commemorate these events, as is written, &quot;<i>If your enemy falls, do not
exult . . . lest the Lord see it and be displeased, and avert His wrath from
him.&quot;<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i><b>A person of
character does not rejoice in his enemy's fall,<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></b>because such joy is displeasing in
God's eyes, and we are obligated to detest that which is displeasing in God's
eyes. Therefore, on Pesach, we do not commemorate<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Chag Hamatzot<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>as the occasion of God's punishing
 Egypt, but in remembrance of the deliverance of the Children of Israel for the
  Land of Egypt. Israel has no festival or Yom Tov in celebraation of an
enemy's downfall.      </p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0pt'>&quot;Nor
shall you break a bone of it&quot; -&nbsp;The real offering consists primarily
of the blood and the flesh (i.e., the muscles), excluding the bones which only
form the passive framework. An offering is essentially a giving up of oneself
and of the activities prompted by one's own will. In the Pesach offering one
receives oneself back. This symbolic &quot;enjoying of oneself again,
represents the gift of the return of one's personality, i.e., regained freedom
of will. This refers primarily only to the <i>'basar</i>&quot;&nbsp;- the
flesh, the active part of the personality (the muscles). With
this&nbsp;basar,&nbsp;this <i>'mevasser'</i>&nbsp;(messenger) of the&nbsp;<i>nefesh</i>,&nbsp;the
soul, there are the bones, the means placed at the service of the will, to
enable the activity of the muscles to function, and to hold the whole together.
They are not the creature itself but they are placed at the disposal of the
creature and in conjunction with it, 'a bone with meat attached', they
represent, not indeed activity, but the means by which activity is achieved. As
long as the&nbsp;<i>basar</i>&nbsp;is on them, they can represent the dedication
by one's own free will of one's activities to God. i.e., as long as
the&nbsp;basar&nbsp;is pure, the bones, as the means used by this free will for
activities, themselves become important, and must be treated with respect, must
be protected from fracture. Apart from their use in conjunction with the&nbsp;<i>basar</i>&nbsp;and
holy uses, the means themselves are worthless. In conjunction with it, they
take on the importance and meaning of our morally free personality. Hence the
dictum: &quot;If there is no&nbsp;<i>kazayit</i>&nbsp;[size of an olive] of meat,
then there is no prohibition against fracturing bones; if it is impure, there
is no prohibition against fracturing bones&quot;. Taken together with the two
preceding precepts the verse would express: No person is to be withdrawn from
the home, no&nbsp;<i>basar</i>&nbsp;from the person, and no bone from the
flesh; the consecrated idea of the home is to hold&nbsp;<b>all and everything
fast to itself</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>.</span></p>
