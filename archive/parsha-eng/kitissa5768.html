completely free hand in the choice of the form, should have just chosen that of
a calf... But we have already had the opportunity on several occasions to
remark - and when we consider the offerings it becomes practically a certainty
- that cattle, (<i>cattle, ox, bull</i>) being serving assistants in carrying
out the work of human beings, represent, in sacrificial symbolism, the using of
one's powers and strength to work in the service of a higher being. So what
Aaron was about, was, on the one hand to satisfy the demands of the people who
were asking not for another god but for another &quot;Moses&quot;, and on the
other hand by doing this to keep the error within the bounds of semi-defection;
and for this purpose no more suitable form could be found than that of cattle,
which represented no directing force but a serving one. And in choosing a calf
and not an ox, Aaron expressed even this form in its weakest aspect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

propose to interpret two dramatic events - the Theophany at Sinai and the Sin
of the Golden Calf - against the background of the stories of Bereishit, whose
major conflicts can be seen as a series of attempts to find the proper way to
communicate with God and to live in a way pleasing to Him. The search for a
proper offering begins with Cain and Abel, but that story is echoed in the
competition between Jacob and Esau to satisfy their father Isaac.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

both stories the sons must bring an offering in order to gain a blessing from
the human or divine Father. The broad question which has occupied humanity

results?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
giving of the Torah marks an essential change in that which is required of God's
servants. Previously, gifts were sufficient to gain God's favor; now the
founding of a just and fair society is needed. Similarly to the stories of the
brothers in Bereishit, here again we find a contest between two types of
worship, and God is quick to make His preference known. However, God's response
to Abel and the rebuff of Esau do not leave us sufficient clues for solving the
puzzle of how to please God. The difference between <i>fruits of the earth</i>
and <i>firstlings of the flock</i> fails to explain God's preferences and
dislikes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
question becomes more pressing in the stories of Jacob and Esau, because their
offerings do not differ in quality. Rather, it is the manner of presentation
and the personality of the person making the offering which determines their
acceptability. Jacob is identified by his voice and Esau by his hands. Voice
and speech express the human soul, they constitute the realization of the
spirit's potential and the materialization of its interiority. The hands, which
represent Esau, symbolize action and activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>To
this we may add that the man of voice, the man of spirit and <i>dweller in
tents</i> bears a soft personality. His is a spiritual personality that makes
its way through the practical world with the help of others or through
trickery, but not by sheer force. In contrast, the<i> man of the field</i> is
muscular and knows how to get things done. He is close to nature and depends

division between the spiritual and abstract on the one side and the tangible
and physical on the other also underlies two distinct modes of worship that
took place, respectively, on Mount Sinai and at its feet. The two brothers,
Moses and Aaron, also represent these two directions. Moses is the <i>man of
God</i>; he represents the demand for belief in a hidden and distant God who
makes stringent demands in the realm of ethics and values. Aaron, in contrast,
is the man of action. He fosters an immediate connection with the people and he
is implicated in the creation of the Calf. Moses is the voice, <i>the voice of
Jacob</i>, while Aaron is the hands which make the calf, as we read in the
verse from Isaiah </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
Tablets and the Golden Calf are polar opposites which draw the soul to opposite
extremes. The Calf was shiny and invited celebration, while the Tablets were
verbal and demanding. It was possible to point towards the Calf and say, <i>This
is your god, O Israel</i>, while the tablets announce <i>I am your God</i>, but
they are only the <i>writing of God</i> Who is without body or the image of a
body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>It
seems that the level of abstraction and the faith in the hidden that were demanded
of the Israelites were beyond their capabilities. Moses, who was late in
returning, expected the Israelites to continue to feel his presence and obey
his commands, thus accustoming themselves to knowledge of an invisible God. However,
it is the nature of every gap to be refilled with new material, as R. Behayey
Ibn Pekuda said, &quot;One who does not trust in God will trust in something
other than God&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>That
is to say: the Israelites did not reject the existence of a Higher Power and
they did not want to replace faith with atheism. Rather, they wanted to replace
God with a strange god. The natural need to hurry up and fill in the gap left
by Moses' disappearance explains why the people failed the very first test of
their maturity, the test of patience and faith. It wasn't only God's hidden
nature that pushed the Israelites into making another God for themselves in His
place. God's demands were also infinitely more difficult than those of the
molten Calf. The <i>I am you God</i> of the Tablets required the performance of
commandments, while the golden statue invited them to feasting and drinking, to
laughter and release. The competition was unfair; this was a difference of
essence and principle, not a narrow difference between the fruits of the earth
and firstlings of the flock, or between game meat and the delicacies of Rebecca's
kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the secret of modern idolatry's charm: &quot;Idolaters believe that god exists
in some object or world-view, or human being. They have a simple formula for
the secret of happiness and the explanation of suffering. They have a list of sacrifices
that must be offered; these constitute the secret of control over their god and
the way to get what they want from him&quot; </span><span style='font-size:

to a strange god, then, consists of every attempt to discern his will through gift
or sacrifices. It consists of the establishment of some means or another as an
end that must be placated with offerings in the form of concessions that bring
us to forget ourselves. Caspi continues in this spirit and reveals the faces of
the false gods which we all worship: the god of societal norms, the god of
technology, the god of happiness and the god of the pursuit of excellence, the
god of youthfulness and a slim figure, the god of consumption and money, and
the god of spirituality and nature. Caspi explains that these kinds of gods
reflect a world that invites us to neglect the difficult missions of life; they
form a system of values in which every sin becomes a commandment </span><span

so, it becomes clear that it was not only the ancient brothers who tried and
failed, who sacrificed and were punished while trying to please God. It was not
only those who left Egypt who were perplexed by the commanding voice that emerged
from the cloud and fog. Our contemporaries also sanctify beliefs and objects
which separate them from the true God, from the difficult demand that they find
their purpose, and from the understanding that while God has no need for their
gifts and sacrifices humans must do their best to fulfill their mission of <i>to

Providence, pride before the fall, and it has been repeatedly validated in all
generations, in connection to individuals as well as nations and kings). This
gave rise to belief in the evil eye in all the nations. It appears that this
belief had already spread into Israel in the generations preceding the giving
of the Torah. God did not want them to completely abandon this belief, given
its being founded on faith in Providence and that it keeps people from trusting
in their power and wealth, which is the principle of the entire Torah...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

take the opposite view. They scoff at <b>belief in the evil eye</b> and many
other things that cannot be explained naturally. I think that both sides to the
controversy are wrong. The world does not behave in accordance with the laws of
material nature alone; there are other laws which were legislated by the
Highest Wisdom at the beginning of Creation. These laws arrange for events to
bring both nations and individuals benefit and loss that testify to Providence.
When the philosopher sees them, he will call them mere happenstance. When the
masses see them, they will call them miracles. The truth is that they are the
natural consequences that necessarily follow their natural causes. However, the
entire system of causes and effects is ordered since the beginning of Creation
in accordance with the wisdom of the Highest Organizer, may His name be blessed...
the decree of <i>pride before the fall</i> is engraved into the procession of
events in the lives of communities and individuals, and it brings about that a
person (or an entire nation) standing at the heights of success, full of pride
and boastful, will cause those who see him to be jealous. Then the wheel [of
fortune] will turn against him and an unexpected catastrophe will overtake him,
and the masses will attribute it to the evil eye, or sometimes to the curses of
his enemies. In reality, the eye does no harm and the curses bring no evil. Justice
is meted out by God, and He decreed and legislated into the chain of causation
leading to the good and the bad that a person's pride will lay him low, while
humility will gain honor. The <i>Me'amer</i> says that the men of that
generation had to give atonement money [<i>kofer</i>] because they had sinned
with the Calf and deserved to be destroyed; however, he forgot that this
command preceded the sin of the Golden Calf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
