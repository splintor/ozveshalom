Moshe was concerned more with the Lord's vengeance, and this requires a high degree
of righteousness, to face the foe and think not about exacting vengeance from
one who did him evil, being concerned only with exacting the vengeance of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Shortly before the beginning of Parashot Matot-Massai, there appears
the command to strike Midian. The Midian revenge episode is puzzling from a
number of aspects. First, at the end of Parashat Balak, where the men of Israel are seduced into sacrificing to Baal Peor, we read: &quot;And Israel camped in Shittim; and
the people began to go whoring with the daughters of <b>Moab</b><b>.</b>&quot; Only
after the Holy One begins to punish the Children of Israel is mention made of
Cozbi daughter of Zur, who was chieftain of the leagues of fathers' houses in
Midian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Second, the Holy One orders Moshe explicitly to strike Midian because
they are foes to the Israelites and because of Cozbi daughter of Zur, their
kinswoman. There is no commandment, however, of any physical retribution
against Moab; there is only an injunction against their &quot;entering the
community.&quot; Yet more: there were more justifiable reasons for taking
revenge against Moab than against Midian, for in addition to the Moabite
daughters seducing the Children of Israel, the Moabites refused to permit the
Israelites passage through their territory. God's command to strike Midian (and
Moshe's understanding was that this included the daughters of Midian) seems, at
first glance, to be unjustified. It seems that the Midianites joined the
Moabites in their enlistment of Balaam son of Beor to assist them, but Moab - with Balak at their head - was the instigator, the Midianites being, it seems, dragged
along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Third, Moshe's order to massacre the women and children is
incomprehensible, even considering acceptable practice in antiquity. Even for
the Israelite warriors who killed every male, this was something difficult to grasp.
And futhermore, this is the only instance recorded in the Torah where the Israelites
are ordered to undergo a process of purification following a military action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Fourth, Moshe's father-in-law, Yitro, was a priest of Midian, and, of
course, Moshe's wife, Zipporah was a Midianite. Yet more, it would seem that
Zipporah was under sentence of death in as much as she was a Midianite woman &quot;who
has known a man&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>We can assume that this <i>parasha</i> was written to impart a
significant message, and this applies both to the content of the commandments
and the means by which they were transmitted to us, their significance
proportionate to their irrationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The ways Israelites relate to external threats are often an allegory
for internal relations. In our case, allegory invites itself, because the
context seems confused and the consequence is frightening. Therefore we ask:
What can we learn from our <i>parasha</i> about the forces raging between us
and ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In my opinion, the parasha invites a meeting between us and the evil resides
inside each of us. As we develop, we are witness to development of the ability
to empathize with the other and to understand the potential significance of actions,
to depart from evil and to do good. But each one of us also has an egoistic
component, inconsiderate and even violent, an element whose existence we often
deny, preferring that it never existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The psychologist Rollo May, in his classic volume &quot;Love and Will&quot;
writes about the daimonic (in contrast to the demonic, the satanic) element in
man. Man is born with a package of 'potentials', drives awaiting activation.
These potentials, motivated by the daemonic drive, are the source of both our
constructive and our destructive components. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>As a rule, we like to believe that we are good people; consciousness of
the evil within us impairs our narcissistic needs. We want to think that there
are bad people and that evil resides only in them. We, however, are the good
guys, and thus we ignore evidence that the potential for doing very bad things
is in all of us. Denial of evil is actually liable to lead to its bursting out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Many of our readers will remember the famous Milgrom experiment. Randomly
picked participants in the experiment were asked to teach a person (a member of
the experiment team) a list of words. For every error, the 'teacher' was to
press a button which supposedly to deliver an electric shock. (The 'student',
of course, would receive no shock, but the 'teacher' was under the impression
that a shock was delivered). With each subsequent error, the 'teacher' was to
increase the shock intensity by ten volts. The experiment conductor wanted to
learn what was the maximum shock intensity the participants were prepared to
deliver as a man in a white jacket would order them to continue with the experiment.
To the conductor's amazement, most of the participants agreed to deliver shocks
which, were they real, would have killed the student. Yet more - most of the
participants were stunned at the realization that they were capable of reaching
such a stage. The lesson learnt, from the experiment and our <i>parasha</i>, is
that the source of evil is not in bad people; it is in ordinary people who are
willing, in certain circumstances, to do bad things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In Stanford University, a different experiment was conducted. Students
were randomly divided into 'prisoners' and 'turnkeys', and performed a prison
simulation in the university basement. They were asked to behave according to
their perceptions of their respective roles. They performed their jobs so 'well',
that the experimenters were forced to halt the experiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Coping with evil requires courage. Courage is a concept which expresses
the ability to overcome circumstances and arrive at the true freedom of choosing
between good and bad. Without the possibility of evil there is no freedom and
no true choice of the good; to desist from evil and to do good, when it is easy
and possible to continue towards the evil, is an act of courage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In our parasha, the exemplification of courage is Yitro and, perhaps,
like her father, Zipporah. Yitro is not only a Midianite, he is a Midianite
priest. He recognizes the moral strength of Judaism, and, according to
traditional commentators, he even takes upon himself the yoke of <i>mitzvoth.</i>
Despite this, he chooses to return to Midian to struggle for the newly
discovered justice. Zipporah, married to Moshe yet before she was aware of
significance of her tie to him (and even before God's mission was revealed to
Moshe at the burning bush), does not understand at first the meaning of her son's
circumcision. But when she experiences from close up the struggle over Moshe's
life, on her own initiative she circumcises her son, and from that moment she,
in effect, leaves her conforming world and is tied emotionally to Moshe with a
covenant of blood. These acts of courage, when Yitro and Zipporah experience
the light unto the nations which radiated from Jacob's tents, became their way
of life which saved them from the fate of the Midianites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The irrational command, as it were, is a metaphor for the inner
imperative within each of us to uncover the evil residing is us, which has its
source in the shadows of our life experiences, and which expresses itself even
in the potential for killing women and children. The way to avoid this passes through
awareness of this potential in order to gather the courage to escape from the
cycle of sin and punishment. The fact that the slaughter was actually realized
is necessary to demonstrate to us, for whom the book was written, the necessity
of choosing, in complete freedom, between real evil, which can literally
materialize, and the courage to resist and do good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The courage to struggle for a more just world begins with acceptance of
the fact that each of us can be basically good, and still do abominable things.
From this harsh message, however, is derived the hope that if evil is so close,
good can also be a handbreadth away, if only we fulfill the obligation to choose
from freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

rule from our passage - Even if it is known with absolute certainty that one is
deserving of death - for example, if the murder transpired in the sight of the
entire court - the murderer may not be executed without due legal process: &quot;From
where [do we learn] that a sanhedrin which witnessed a person killing a person
is not to be executed before he stands before a different court? The Torah
teaches: '<i>Before he stands before the assembly for judgement</i>'<span

to what is said here, that same legal procedure must be carried out before

serve as witnesses; they may not serve as judges, for the sages said<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Rosh
Hashanah 26a) </span>regarding capital cases, a witness may not be a judge:
whoever was present at the act as witness cannot be a judge in that case, for
the duty of the court is to acquit the accused if at all possible. But since he
saw him kill a person, he will not be able to find [extenuating circumstances]
on his behalf. The act leaves its impression on all who observed, and they will
not be able judge him objectively and find cause for acquittal.</p>
