Shabbat our synagogue readings - in the Torah <span class=SpellE><i>parashah</i></span><i>
</i>and the haphtarah - are focused upon two confrontations with idolatry: the
Torah reading, which deals with the incident of the Golden Calf and Moses'
struggle against it; and the confrontation between the prophet Elijah and the
priests of Baal at Mount Carmel read in the haphtarah, taken from 1 Kings 18 (a
haphtarah which is not read every year, as Shabbat <span class=SpellE>Ki</span>
Tisa frequently coincides with <span class=SpellE><i>Parshat</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>Parah</span></i>). While the Torah portion and the haphtarah
usually bear upon related subjects, they are often a study in contrasts as
well, offering different perspectives on the subject at hand. I would like to
reflect upon these two passages, both in terms of their obvious similarities as
well as what I see as a striking difference between them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The incident of the Golden Calf is a familiar
one. The people, confused and frightened when Moses &quot;tarries&quot; on <st1:place
w:st="on">Mount Sinai</st1:place>, asks Aaron to make &quot;a god, who will go
before us&quot;; he gathers their golden ornaments and fashions a molten calf,
which becomes an object of orgiastic worship. Upon descending from the mountain
and seeing this spectacle, Moses is filled with wrath, hurls the two tablets of
the covenant from his hands and, gathering a faithful remnant from the tribe of
Levi, <span class=GramE>goes</span> through the camp killing some three
thousand people who had worshiped the calf. God then tells Moses that He is
ready to destroy the people and make his family His people in their stead. Moses
refuses this offer; having meantime calmed from his anger, he returns to his
earlier role as defender of the people and begins a protracted process during
which he beseeches God's mercy, persuading Him to relent of His destructive
intention. God recants (in two stages) and ultimately reveals to Moses His
Thirteen Qualities of Mercy. Thus, by the end of the chapter both God and Moses
relent of their consuming anger and instead turn to a position of compassion,
understanding, and a renewed attempt to continue covenantal life with this
often &quot;stiff-necked people.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Several years ago I suggested in this forum </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(<i>Shabbat Shalom, <span
class=SpellE>Ki</span> Tisa </i>5762)</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>, that this chapter ought to be read as offering
a new understanding of the covenant, based upon mercy, compassion and
understanding of human weakness, as against the original Sinai covenant, which
was based upon unconditional obedience to the Law. I referred to these as the &quot;Covenant
of Sinai&quot; and the &quot;Covenant of the Cleft of the Rock,&quot; or as the
&quot;revelation of Shavuot&quot; and the &quot;revelation of Yom Kippur.&quot;
My original inspiration for this idea came from the late biblical scholar Jacob
<span class=SpellE>Milgrom</span> who, in an Appendix to his <i>JPS Torah
Commentary: Numbers</i>, observed that, if one <span class=GramE>analyzes</span>
the structure of the <span class=SpellE>Hextateuch</span> - that is to say, the
six books consisting of the Torah plus the Book of Joshua - one finds a pattern
of symmetry at whose center one finds Exodus 34: that is to say, the revelation
to Moses in the Cleft of the Rock. Thus, the very structure of these biblical

font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The chapter concerning the confrontation between
Elijah and the priests of Baal presents us with a very different sort of story.
Elijah sees himself as virtually alone in confronting the wicked King Ahab and
the priests of Baal and <span class=SpellE>Asherah</span>, whose cult enjoys a
privileged position under Ahab's rule. Elijah is persecuted by the king for his
loyalty to the God of Israel and his outspoken criticism of the latter's
support of idolatry. In a dramatic confrontation on Mount Carmel, Elijah
proposes a test to demonstrate to the people, who <span class=GramE>&quot; hop</span>
between the two branches,&quot; the identity of the true god: Baal or the Lord
God of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Two altars are constructed - one on which a sacrifice will be offered to Baal,
and the other on which a sacrifice will be offered to the Lord - and &quot;the
God who answers in fire, He is God&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(1 Kings 18:24)</span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. Elijah allows the worshipers of Baal -
who are far more numerous than himself - to go first; they try all morning and
through early afternoon, calling on Baal to show his acceptance of the
sacrifice. Elijah mocks them with biting sarcasm: &quot;Call out with a loud
voice... perhaps he is talking, or has gone for a walk; or perhaps he is
sleeping and will wake up&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(v. 27)</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. The priests of Baal redouble their efforts,
mutilating themselves with swords and spears (reminiscent of contemporary <span
class=SpellE>Shi'ites</span>?), but to no avail. Finally, &quot;at the time of
the afternoon offering,&quot; Elijah builds an altar, slaughters a bull, and
pours water over the sacrifice and the altar and the deep ditch he has dug all
around it, to assure that it will not ignite easily. He then utters a brief but
eloquent prayer, and immediately is answered by fire coming down from heaven,
consuming the sacrifice, the wood, the earth of the altar, and all the water
around. &quot;And all the people standing there fell on their faces declared, 'the
Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God'&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

stories? Why in the end do both God and Moses have mercy upon the people of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> who made
the calf (notwithstanding the murder of many of the leaders), whereas Elijah is
unrelenting in his zealotry against the priests of Baal? The difference is
rooted, both in the nature of the respective idolatries, and in a difference
between the two principle figures and their conception of their respective
roles. The worshippers of the Calf were ordinary people, recently freed slaves
who had participated in the Exodus, stood at Mount Sinai and now, in a moment
of weakness, had succumbed to the need for a substitute for their revered
leader who seemed to have abandoned them. More than anything else, this story
illustrates the limitations of human beings. Even the greatest ideal, the most
impressive and soul-shattering experience, do not change people forever: after
a short period of time - in this case, a mere forty days - in face of some
powerful emotion, be it trauma, fear, and insecurity, it may be forgotten. God,
so to speak, comes to realize that the strict path of uncompromising demands He
had imposed upon them does not work. The people require mercy, forgiveness, and
need allowance to be made for their all too human shortcomings. In brief, the
making of the calf, even if not committed in error in the technical sense, was
very close to being unintentional. It was a decision made by people who were
not fully cognizant of the implications of what they were doing, who were moved
by strong emotion and fear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

he did throughout his life as a leader): he was the teacher par excellence of
Torah, the prophet who brought God's word to the people, and was as such
passionately opposed to this incursion of paganism into the life of the people.
But he was also the leader of the people, a kind of loving father who sought,
in whatever way possible, to reconcile them to their Heavenly Father so that
they might continue on their path towards their destiny - with all the
stumbling blocks and backsliding they might encounter on the way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

He was concerned, in single-minded fashion, with convincing the vacillating
people that the Lord alone is God. The entire confrontation on <st1:place

himself as utterly alone in this struggle: &quot;and I alone remain as a

privileged status within Ahab's kingdom. They were, so to speak, a classic
example of people who acted out of <span class=SpellE>zadon</span>, deliberate
choice; and the only way to deal with this, at least so Elijah believed, was
through frontal confrontation, aimed not so much at them as at the public who
were vacillating between the two positions as to which was true. And this is what

the path of zealotry is fraught with <span class=GramE>dangers which there is</span>
no need to elaborate, as we unfortunately see in our own day. The second <span

incorporates momentary anger and zealotry against an overall, long-lasting

class=SpellE>v'agadot</span> [<span class=SpellE>halachic</span> explications]…
the meaning behind all this is that the first set of tablets did not include
the authority to create new laws, only that which Moshe received, close
readings and fine distinctions and those laws inherent in them; they did not
authorize creation of new laws through the 13 rules and Talmudic exposition.
The oral law consisted only of those things received from Moshe's mouth; and
those not directly received were extracted by comparison of like things. The
second set of tablets, however, authorized every distinguished scholar to
create laws according to the 13 rules and the Talmud… And for this reason, the
Holy One ordered that the second set be engraved by Moshe, not because they
were not worthy of Divine inscription, but in order to teach that new
legislation authorized by these tablets are with the partnership of human
endeavor with the help of Heaven, just as the tablets themselves were the work
of Moshe and the script of God… the writing was also with Moshe's
participation. And this is what was meant by <span class=SpellE>Chazal's</span>
statement that even that which authorized scholars will in the future innovate
was already on the tablets, the meaning being that everything existed
potentially in the second tablets… and because of this the Holy One [adding on
to &quot;the first tablets&quot; the words ] &quot;Asher <span class=SpellE>shibarta</span>
[&quot;which you have broken&quot; ] and <span class=SpellE>Chazal</span>

for you that you broke them&quot; [an rewriting based on the similarity between
<span class=SpellE>asher</span> and <span class=SpellE>yasher</span>], because
this [breaking of the tablets] strengthened the authority of the oral law which
is the essential part of the second covenant made after the golden calf, because
after the first set was smashed and the second set was written in a version which
was initially received orally, they then knew that even the tablets, which were
the beginning of the written law, included matters of received tradition which already
existed in the beginning. From this we can understand the power of received traditions
which came down and were passed on, and all are the words of the Living God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
