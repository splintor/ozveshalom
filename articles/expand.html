<H3>SYNOPSIS: </H3>
<P ALIGN="justify">The government has decided to lift the freeze on building in the territories and to
expand existing settlements. </P>

<H3>OUR POSITION: </H3>

<P ALIGN="justify">In accordance with the <A HREF="wise.php">peace process supported by our movement</A>, approximately
7% of the West Bank, referred to by some as "Yesha", and by others as "the
conquered territories" will be annexed. As long as the territorial increase is within the
scale of 7% of the territories, we will support the decision, but with reservations. We
do not support the prerogative of ruling of another nation.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Palestinians are oppressed and living as a conquered people.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Palestinians will not accept the humiliation of the Palestine Authority, if there is no
progress towards peace. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The government hastens to commit acts challenging the Palestine Administration and
erodes its legitimacy to administer their populace. Every Shekel committed to
settlement should be counter balanced with a like amount for the benefit of the
Palestinians, in order not to aggravate the gap between them and ourselves.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">We are motivated, not by love for the Palestinians but by the love of Israel.</P>
