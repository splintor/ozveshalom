<H1>The Conversion Bill</H1>

<P ALIGN="center">

<P ALIGN="justify"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>"The Jewish people emerged in
the Land of Israel... after the nation was exiled from its land its
beliefs remained intact... through a historical and traditional
connection in which Jews of every generation dreamed of returning and
settling in their ancient homeland."</B></FONT> -- from Israel&rsquo;s
Declaration of Independence.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The State of Israel is supposed to serve as a home
for Jews and a guarantee that another Jewish Holocaust will not
occur. However, there were many nations that did not recognize the
State of Israel. Even some ultra-orthodox opposed the state&rsquo;s
establishment and all that it symbolized.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Nevertheless, since the founding of the state, a
group of ultra-orthodox Jews have been attempting to define who is a
Jew according to the halakhic criteria that both they and we deem
appropriate. But they sought to use halakha exclusively. It is
apparent that the passing of legislation on the conversion bill will
conclusively tear the Jewish people apart and cast the periphery of
Israel - some of whom are beginning to acquire an appreciation of
their Jewish heritage - out of the Jewish world. Indeed, for this
reason the pending legislation on who is a Jew has not yet been made
law in the Knesset. There is also a basic absurdity here, that the
Israeli Knesset has the power to make religious decisions when they
are not capable or fit to do so. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Furthermore, this is being done with the help of
people who themselves do not accept the law of the State of Israel,
and who denigrate the law and its representatives while using the
non-religious community and the Knesset to make laws that would only
make life more difficult for those very people. As a religious-Zionist
movement, we believe that the National Religious Party (NRP) should
have vocally objected to the division that such legislation would
bring about. The religious-Zionist community must demonstrate that it
is possible to adhere to the Biblical commandments while safeguarding
democratic values. Unfortunately, in this case, the NRP has become
part of the ultra-orthodox political bloc and instead of forging a
Jewish consensus, they seem to be destroying the few Jewish ties that
remain and the little Jewish unity we once had. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">However, we believe that the damage being done can
yet be repaired. Netivot Shalom proposes that it can be determined
that a Jew is someone who was converted by an Orthodox, Conservative,
or Reform Beit Din (religious court), and then write "Jewish" under
"religion" on this person&rsquo;s Israeli national identity card while
specifying the type of conversion under "ethnicity." With good will, a
common Beit Din for all the Jewish denominations can be
established. If done properly with respect for all humanity, we
believe that guidelines can be established that would be acceptable to
all sides. If there is no animosity or divisive political agendas
between the varying sides, agreement can be reached. </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">There is no halakhic pressure here; rather there is
political manhandling. We believe that the time has come for the
majority, and not just the minority, to assert its rights.  As a
religious-Zionist movement we see a necessity to maintain the status
quo that has existed since the establishment of the state. Judaism has
always been a religion of argument in search of truth. Do not allow a
political argument tear the Jewish people apart. </P>
