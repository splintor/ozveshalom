might think that this injunction is to be taken literally. Therefore it says,
'And thou shall gather in thy corn', which implies that you are to combine the
study of them with a worldly occupation. This is the view of R. Ishmael. R.
Simeon b. <span class=SpellE>Yohai</span> says: Is that possible? If a man
ploughs in the <span class=SpellE>ploughing</span> season, and sows in the
sowing season, and reaps in the reaping season, and threshes in the threshing
season, and winnows in the season of wind, what is to become of the Torah? No;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Ki-Tissa</span> begins with God
asking Moshe to gather from the children of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> a donation of half a shekel
which was to serve a double purpose - to count the population and to build the <span
class=SpellE>Mishkan</span>. &quot;The wealthy person shall not give more nor
shall the pauper not give less than half a shekel to atone for their lives&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 30:15). </span>I
read this command as a hint of the extended narrative of the sin of the calf
which is presented in this <span class=SpellE><i>parasha</i></span>. The giving
of <b>half</b> a shekel, a coin of incomplete value, hints at the fracture to
occur in the coming chapters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>We meet the
Children of Israel on their long wilderness journey here. After forty-nine days
of trekking through the wide and wild wilderness, slowly, step after step, the
Children of Israel move further away from their past as servants under Pharaoh's
rule, and come closer to the future - a nation that knows its Torah, accepts
upon itself the yoke of God and dwells securely in the promised land. They
reach one of the high points of the journey - the epiphany at Sinai and the
receiving of the Tablets of Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>A few chapters
preceding our current <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>, in <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span>
<span class=SpellE>Yitro</span>, we are told of the Children of Israel standing
at the foot of the mountain, waiting to receive the two Tablets of Covenant.
After long wanderings in the barren wilderness, after the desert winds blew
above them, peeling away some of the difficulties of life in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>, they wash and cleanse
themselves in preparation for hearing the words of Living God. And <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sinai</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
was covered in smoke and lightening and the rumbling voice of God is heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Following this
awesomely impressive event, God invites Moshe to ascend to Him and to receive
the engraved Tablets of the Covenant, and Moshe remains with Him for forty days
and forty nights. This was such a long time for the Children of Israel to be
without Moshe. The period that they spent at the foot of the mountain was only
a bit less than all their trekking in the desert until arriving at Sinai - forty-nine
days. It was really difficult for them - we can almost imagine them looking up
with hope to the top of the mountain peak, anxious to see Moshe's familiar
figure descending the dirt path, waiting to hear again his comforting voice
which directs them through the winding desert ways. &quot;And the people saw
that Moshe lagged in coming down from the mountain [...] this man Moshe who
brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him&quot;
(<span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Shemot</span></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> 32:1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>They demand a
replacement, consolation, a different figure to enter the empty space opened in
their hearts. &quot;Rise up, make us gods that will go before us [...]&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid.), </span>they ask of <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span>,
and <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> complies. He removes their gold ornaments
and melts them into a molten calf. <span class=GramE>A shining calf, radiant, a
luminescence of warm pleasant gold.</span> <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span>
fashions for them a statue in their own image, a tender calf that wants to suck
and be warmed between its mother's breasts. &quot;These are your gods, O
Israel.&quot; How pleasant to find shelter in the shadow of a god who resembles
ourselves, tender and young as ourselves, not threatening and not intimidating
with blasts and flashes and thunder. The people rise to life &quot;And the
people came back from eating and drinking and they rose up to play&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(32:6). </span>After all this great anticipation,
after the barren wilderness and empty hearts watching in vain for Moshe, there
is great relief in gathering around the gold calf. <span class=GramE>Consolation
in eating and fulfillment of the basic need for nourishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>&quot;And
Moshe turned and came down the mountain, with the two Tablets of the Covenant
in his hand&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(32:15</span>). Moshe
approaches the encampment and he cannot believe his eyes. The people to whom he
devotes his heart, the people of which he was the heart, this people could not
wait for him and his direction; they made for themselves a calf of gold as a
replacement for God. In his great fury he smashes the tablets &quot;and Moshe's
wrath flared, and he flung the tablets from his hand and smashed them at the
bottom of the mountain&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(32:19</span>).
What a powerful picture! The Tablets of the Covenant, sculpted and engraved by
the hand of God himself, shattered against the rocks of the mountain. Had they
waited only a bit longer, patiently restraining themselves, they would have
received the real thing - tablets written in God's handwriting. What great
greater gift could they possibly receive from God to signify the binding
covenant between them? The two tablets, inscribed on both sides, were intended
to be a wondrous unification of the two forces, the people and - through Moshe
- God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>There is, at
first glance, great tragedy in this event. A nation standing at the threshold
of an amazing experience, deviates from the path a moment before the event. In
my opinion, however, just as we are obliged to look at difficult and painful
events in our personal lives with an understanding eye, so must we consider
difficult events in our national <span class=GramE>history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Actually, by
making the golden calf, <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> facilitated liberation
from all the hard experiences and heavy baggage which the Children of Israel
carried with them throughout the wilderness sojourning and the servitude in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
He unloads from them, unburdens them, relieves them, <span class=GramE>exposes</span>
them bare of defense mechanisms. Ornaments can also represent beliefs and
conceptions which pass down from generation to generation. Just as a mother
passes on to her daughter a precious necklace which belonged to Grandma, so a
nation passes on to future generations the consciousness of slavery which
attended the people throughout its years in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>. And <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span>
melts all these ornaments into a single unit, thereby freeing the nation from
the yoke of the past, from the fears, from the dependency. Now they are more
open and ready to receive something new.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Facing this,
Moshe who broke the tablets; he too has created an additional opening for
rapprochement between the people and God. For what is a fracture if not an
entrance, a crack through which light may enter. <span class=GramE>As Leonard
Cohen sings: &quot;There is a crack in everything, that's how the light comes
in&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>For me the
broken tablets are a symbol of the possibility of coming closer, an opening to
great intimacy with the Lord. Instead of solid tablets, made from impenetrable
stone, we received broken tablets, and between the cracks we have room to
enter, there is room for true and full merger with God. Perhaps this is why, at
the beginning of the <span class=SpellE><i>parasha</i></span>, the people are
told to construct the tabernacle from the donations of half-shekels. The
half-shekels make it possible to build a sanctuary which will carry the shards
and their unification into a whole from the contributions of the masses. &quot;There
is nothing <span class=GramE>so</span> complete as a broken heart&quot; as <span
class=SpellE>Rebbe</span> <span class=SpellE>Menachem</span> Mendel of <span
class=SpellE>Koztk</span> used to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>After Moshe
breaks the tablets, he himself creates new tablets and God inscribes upon them
again the words which were written on the first tablets. What is the difference
between the two sets? The second set <b>really</b> connects God and <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Man.</st1:State></st1:place> They are not given
as a complete unit from God to <span class=GramE>nation,</span> they are the
fruit of a joint project of Moshe and God, both in their work and in their
conversation. Moshe climbs the mountain with the tablets that he sculpted and
when they are in his hands he prays to God: &quot;The Lord, the Lord! A
compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in kindness and
good faith [...]&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(34:6), </span>and God
answers his prayers and forgives the people its sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>I dedicate
this <span class=SpellE><i>dvar</i></span><i> Torah</i> to my father, Gerald
Cromer, of blessed memory, who, in the <span class=SpellE>Kol</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nidre</span> service of Yom Kippur eve, would bring his sensitive,
fractured heart into the prayer, thereby bringing the congregation closer to
their hearts and to God, and who, on Purim, was always willing to crack his <span
class=GramE>masculinity</span> and dress as a woman. I miss him terribly and
hope that I, too, merit <span class=GramE>to walk</span> in the ways of his

the Torah wanted to teach us and set for us an example for all <span
class=GramE>generations, that</span> this indeed can happen. The very
assumption that people who stood at the foot of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType>
Sinai cannot, are not able to sink again into ignorance, into foolishness, into
the abomination of idolatry - is basically flawed [...] revealed miracles - one-time
wonders - do not change man, his nature, his habits. They may astonish him
momentarily, but they do not separate him from his world, his conceptions, his
past, <span class=GramE>his</span> routines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the month of Elul, 5757, my
good friend, Gerald Cromer <span class=SpellE>z&quot;l</span>, who was then
chairman <span class=SpellE>OzveShalom</span>/ <span class=SpellE>Netivot</span>
Shalom, approached me with an offer to edit a weekly <span class=SpellE><i>parasha</i></span><i>
</i>sheet to be distributed among synagogues, a message with a different voice
of religious Zionism, which draws its inspiration from the Torah of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I first got to know Gerald on the
bus to Bar <span class=SpellE>Ilan</span>, where he served as a professor in
the Criminology Department. Shortly after our first meeting, we became
neighbors and close friends, and hardly a day passed without our conversing. We
used to celebrate Seder eve together and Gerald invited us every year to
consider the &quot;straits&quot; <span dir=RTL></span><span lang=HE dir=RTL><span
dir=RTL></span>(</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:David'>ÓÈˆ¯ÈÌ</span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL>)</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> from which
we wished to exit. We also learned in <span class=SpellE><i>chevrutah</i></span>
for many years, and <span class=SpellE>Mashechet</span> <span class=SpellE>Berachot</span>
- which we learned together with two more friends - we completed on the first
anniversary of his passing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>While yet in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>, Gerald was involved in social and
spiritual activity, and when he immigrated to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> he was active from the very
first moment in social projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>From a very personal and involved
position, he identified what was lacking in Israeli society and labored
tirelessly to bring about change. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When he sensed that the existing
synagogues no longer provided a place that answered his spiritual needs, he
established, together with friends, <span class=SpellE>Kehillat</span> <span
class=SpellE>Yedidya</span>, which strives to realize principles of female
participation in the synagogue within the perimeters of <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>halacha</span></span>, and promotes action for peace and social
justice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When he sensed that within the
national-religious schools there <span class=GramE>existed</span> a tendency
towards extremism, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class=GramE>withdrawal</span>
and nationalistic influences, he, together with a group of friends, established
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Efrata</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, which opened its
gates to the children of the neighborhood to education towards tolerance and
acceptance of the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Before the First Lebanon War and
before the Jewish underground, there existed a small movement of religious
intellectuals called &quot;Oz <span class=SpellE>V'Shalom</span>&quot; which
defined itself as an ideological group for religious Zionism. During the period
of the Jewish underground and even more during the First Lebanon War, there was
a feeling prevalent in a larger public - <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>which also included yeshiva students <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>- that there is place for a wider movement
which would express the feeling that something went wrong in the order of value
priorities of part of the religious national community, and in the assembly
which met in Bet <span class=SpellE>Agron</span>, Jerusalem, to establish &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Netivot</span> Shalom&quot;, two featured speakers were <span
class=SpellE>Rav</span> <span class=SpellE>Amital</span>, <span class=SpellE>z&quot;l</span>,
and <span class=SpellE>Rav</span> Lichtenstein, heads of the <span
class=SpellE>Har</span> <span class=SpellE>Etzion</span> Yeshiva. Gerald was,
of course, one of those led the organization of this new movement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Following the murder of Yitzchak Rabin,
Gerald thought that the most suitable place for the reading of the <span
class=SpellE>Eicha</span> scroll on <span class=SpellE>Tisha</span> <span
class=SpellE>B'Av</span> night would be alongside Yitzchak Rabin's grave. This
is because the greatest threat to our existence as a Jewish (and democratic)
state and the most palpable danger of destruction are latent in baseless
hatred, that is, in the inability to accept the other and in incitement, and
since then, every year, we meet on Mount Herzl for the reading of <span
class=SpellE>Eicha</span> and the recitation of lamentations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>On <span class=SpellE>Tisha</span>
<span class=SpellE>B'Av</span> 5765, the day before the disengagement from Gush
<span class=SpellE>Katif</span>, Gerald organized a public symposium in
Jerusalem's Bell Garden, in which representatives of all shades of the
ideological and political rainbow, religious and secular, expressed their
personal feelings about what was about to happen. This twilight assembly had no
chairman. Each speaker introduced the following speaker, and it was impressive
and touching to see that, despite the intense feelings and deep disagreements
which divided the public, it was possible to conduct a respectful discussion
even in disagreement. This was in part because of the sensitivity which
characterized Gerald; despite his deep commitment to the values in which he
believed, he was a true pluralist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Shortly before his death, when
there was great distress in the south, especially in <span class=SpellE>Sderot</span>,
because of the exposure to missiles from the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Gaza</st1:place></st1:City> strip, Gerald believed that ways must be
found to support this development town. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When, upon returning from a round
of lectures in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, he discovered that he was very sick,
Gerald asked me: What should a man do, when he knows that his days are
numbered? At the time I could not believe that in only six weeks he would leave
us, but <b>he knew</b>, and until his last moments he strove to live a life
with meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>You showed us the way, dear
Gerald. A source of inspiration and motivator, you are lacking, but we shall
try to continue, each in his place, to act on behalf of those values in which
you believed, and in which we believe, for the sake of a better Israeli
society, more just and peace-loving.</p>
