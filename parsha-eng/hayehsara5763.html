the eyes of our Sages, even though the denouement was unfortunate and
saddening. Yitchak, they said, went to the well in the desert, and brought
Hagar from there to Avraham; he himself brought his &quot;stepmother&quot;. And
he had so loved his mother! And he went there, even though he had not yet been
comforted over the loss of his mother! Be these words understood as historical
fact or as an instructive <i>derasha, </i>in either case we learn about the
weltanschauung which characterized our sages. In contrast to them, how much has
our generation declined; tension - if not outright hatred - exists between
adult progeny and their fathers as a result of second marriage! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

after the demise of his mother Sara, Yitzchak went to return his stepmother to
his father. He went to Beer-lahai-roi to bring Hagar, who had been banished by
his mother, to return her to his father and to correct the injustice. Aggadic
narrative is replete with praise of Hagar, who is identified with Keturah: &quot;Why
is she called Keturah? Because her actions were pleasing, as incense (<i>ketoret</i>)&quot;.
This flowery explication testifies to the degree which our great thinkers
reflected upon the actions of our fathers, noting every blemish and fault they
had, and considered their repair. The generations have much to learn from this.
It is wrong to idealize all that occurred; we should see things as they were,
trying to understand them, judging them and pondering their rectification <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
our parasha we meet Avraham approaching the end of life. W have followed the
many and varied events which befell him, from the outset of his journey from
the land of his birth as an emigrant bound for a strange land, until his old
age, fully at home in his new land. It may be said that in this stage of his
life, Avraham has reached a period of calm and tranquillity, living in comfort,
not having to worry about his spiritual, social, or economic status. The
emigrant who left his birthplace and moved to a distant land has managed to
settle, to beget children, to find his place among the inhabitants of the land
and to receive an explicit promise from the God to which he cleaves, that this
land, the Land of Canaan, will be given to his descendents. This promise is
given to Avraham on a number of occasions throughout the preceding parshiyot,
and certainly after the trial of the Akeida he should have felt secure in this
promise and in his right to the land. Despite this trust, examination of
Avraham's actions in this parasha not only provides a picture of proper comportment,
but also offers a detailed lesson on the manner in which people coming from
afar to a place already inhabited by others should behave towards their
surroundings - even when the new arrivals know that this land was promised them
by God. <b>It seems that Avraham's main actions in this parasha - the burial of
Sarah and the seeking of a spouse for his son Yitzhak, are a direct
continuation of his actions throughout his life, and they provide direction for
future generations.<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
parasha opens with Avraham's weeping and eulogizing his wife. One would not
expect moments of mourning to be times for consideration of others, and
certainly not of those outside the close family circle. Avraham, as recipient
of the promise of the land, could have decided to bury Sarah wherever he saw
fit, without prior arrangement or official appeal to any authority. Upon study
of the story of the purchase of cave of Machpelah, however, we find an example
of how Avraham opens friendly negotiations for the acquisition of a plot containing
the cave. Avraham does not assume that the Lord's promise grants him the right
to do in the Land as he sees fit. Addressing the Hittites, he emphasizes: &quot;<i>I
am a resident alien among you, sell me a burial site among you, that I may
remove my dead for burial.&quot; </i>Avraham presents himself as an alien and a
resident, and the commentators explain that he is actually emphasizing: &quot;I
came from a foreign land to dwell here, and I settled among you, subsequently,
I have no family burial plot here, permit me to purchase land here, and allow
me - you citizens of the town - to bury the deceased of my family, for there
can be no family plot without the permission of the inhabitants of the town.&quot;
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(Rashbam,
Bereishit 23:5).</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
these words, Avraham explains his foreignness and his need to seek something
which, were he a local dweller, he would not have had to seek in this fashion.
It can be assumed that in his moments of mourning Avraham senses
intensification of his loneliness and his otherness; the death of Sarah, who
had accompanied him on his long way from Harran to the Land of Canaan,
certainly left him with a feeling of isolation and aloneness. Despite this, the
reaction of the people of Chevron attests to a certain degree of surprise at
Avraham's request. Their answer &quot;<i>Hear us, my lord, you are the elect of
God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places&quot; </i>indicates
how much Avraham had integrated among the inhabitants of the town. But, despite
their reaction, Avraham insists upon demarcation of the area purchased and upon
summarization of the details, so as to be certain that the deal not be subject
to future question. Even though it would seem that Avraham could easily have
come and set up a gravesite without the permission of the natives or any sort
of local authority - and there would have no overt criticism - Avraham is
careful to maintain proper and orderly relations with his neighbors. The deal
is concluded at the town gate, with Efron publicly proclaiming his willingness
to give Avraham the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Avraham's
action and the Hebronites' reaction reflect the neighborly and peaceful
relations which Avraham was careful to nurture throughout his years in the Land
of Canaan. These relations began with his relative Lot, when Avraham shared the
grazing lands with him. As in the case of the Machpelah purchase, there, too,
Avraham was concerned that the other party to the agreement be satisfied with
the agreement. Avraham does not exploit his authority as recipient of the
divine promise, but rather permits the other party to be a partner, thus
guaranteeing that life together be conducted without conflict. Such is also the
case with the wells at Beer Sheva, and the treaty cut with Avimelech. In this
case, too, Avraham seeks to ascertain that Avimelech agree that his claim has
substance. Avimelech's reaction &quot;<i>I do not know who did this; you did
not tell me, nor have I heard of it until today&quot; </i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(Bereishit 21:26) </span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is indicative of civil relations between
the two, Avimelch stressing that he would never had done such a thing, for they
had entered into a covenant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 dir=LTR>Avraham's spirit of consideration of others
is so pronounced that even his servant is guided by that principle in arranging
the marriage of Avraham's son, a matter which Avraham wished to settle before
his demise, immediately after Sarah's passing. Avraham does not explain to the
servant how to determine whether or not he has found the suitable wife. He only
commands him to find a woman who will agree to come to a strange land. Such a
woman will fulfill Avraham's requirement that Yitzchak not wed a local girl
(such girls being unsuitable - in Avraham's eyes - for Yitzchak). It will be
seen that it is essential for her to know how to live in a foreign land,
behaving accordingly. Avraham does not give the servant specific orders, but
the latter knows how to find the appropriate bride. The test he will administer
at the well symbolizes those values of hospitality and concern that all, local
and alien alike, feel at ease with him. Rivka does not know the servant, nor
does she ask questions. Despite this, and notwithstanding the physical
difficulty of watering stock (as can be determined from other Biblical
narratives - Yaakov and Rachel, Tsipporah and Moshe), she does not hesitate to
give drink to the servant and his camels, and to invite them to her home. Her
behavior is in the spirit which Avraham intended to impart to his progeny; her
Harran behavior will accompany her to the new land in which she will feel
different and alien, despite the divine promise of the land for future
generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
would seem that there is no better expression of Avraham's success in effecting
good and proper relations with his social environment - both within his family
and among his neighbors - in making all feel at ease, than that which is
described at the end of the parasha. Avraham is buried alongside Sarah in the
Machpelah Cave, and the Bible points out explicitly that no one questions
Avraham's ownership of the plot - right in the middle of the field of Efron ben
Tsohar the Hittite. No one in the town was angry about Avraham's settling among
them. Yet more, Avraham is buried by his two sons, Yitzchak and Yishmael,
potential contenders for the birthright and the right to the Land. Instead, we
see the two - together - burying their father, thereby observing his legacy of
good and proper relations among themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
summarize, Avraham's behavior during his life and at the time of Sarah's interment
is a guide as to how a newcomer should behave upon coming to a place where
others already live. The division of the land between the shepherds of Avraham
and of Lot, the division of the wells - a basic need for existence of normal
life - and Avraham's concern, when setting aside for himself an area for his
personal needs, that the arrangement be acceptable and agreed upon by the local
population, all these can serve as an example of the way in which we should
conduct our relations with our surroundings. We should learn from Avraham, who,
despite the divine promise given him, did not establish <i>faits accomplis, </i>but
rather developed a considerate and mutual set of relationships with the
inhabitants of the land, and passed this legacy on to his daughter-in-law and
his son... and, hopefully, to generations after them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

flawed and morally reprehensible. Moshe Rabeinu was not &quot;a freedom fighter&quot;,
and he did not kill the Egyptian in order to undermine the Egyptian
subjugation. All he did was to save a Hebrew from an Egyptian who had risen to kill
him, by killing the would-be killer (the law of '<i>rodef&quot;)</i>: <i>&quot;...
when Moshe had grown up, he went out to his kinsfolk and witnessed their
labors. He saw an Egyptian <b>smiting</b> a Hebrew, on of his kinsman. He

to the actions of both the Egyptian and of Moshe makes clear that in both cases
it refers to smiting with the objective of killing (a very common Biblical
usage, such as in Bereishit 4:15, Samuel I, 18:6), and that Moshe's action was
justified (measure for measure). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

death without a trial: &quot;<i>When Pharaoh learned of the matter, <b>he
sought to kill Moshe, but Moshe fled from Pharaoh.&quot;</b></i><b> </b>Pharaoh
was unable to put Moshe on trial only because he had managed to escape, not
because &quot;he understood that he had no authority to judge the leader of a
people seeking freedom.&quot; Pharaoh is described in the Torah and etched in
our consciousness as a murderous tyrant (&quot;<i>you shall throw every son
born into the Nile&quot;)</i>, yet you are prepared to pass him off as an
enlightened and far-sighted thinker, only so that you can publicly announce

the Israeli side, that the (security) goals should not in any way justify all
means, while you afford Barghouti moral support and reinforcement of his
loathsome doctrine that the (national) goal does indeed justify all means! By
doing so, not only are you guilty of a double moral standard (permitting them
that which you deny us), but you also take upon yourself responsibility for
strengthening their hand in the shedding of innocent blood (&quot;Even a Jew like
Shammai Leibowitz justifies our actions&quot;). The denunciation of Israeli
