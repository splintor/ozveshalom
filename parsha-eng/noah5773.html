that Noah still feared that the waves may rise and that in their tumult the waves

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>&quot;Come,
let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, to make a name
for ourselves&quot; - so say the descendents of Noah, and begin to plan the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, the first skyscraper in history.
They know the story about the great flood that inundated the land, leaving only
Noah's ark in the world. By erecting a solid and high tower, they hoped to
defeat the powers of nature and to provide young humanity with quiet and
security. The story begins with an outburst of energy, but ends badly. God does
not issue a building permit; instead He scatters the people across the face of
the earth and confuses their language. Instead of unity and cooperation,
difference and disunity come into being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>At first, it
would seem that this is a story of a brave initiative, of cooperation between
all men towards a single goal. Were the story to end differently, the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> could have become the symbol of
human unity. &quot;All the earth was one language and one set of words&quot; is
the basis for the blueprint of the tower. One who is not acquainted with the
denouement of the story is liable to mistakenly think that the story is about a
vision of peace in &quot;the end of days&quot;. The proclamation of intent
could easily become a Zionist anthem: &quot;Come, let us build us a city and a
tower with its top in the heavens, that we may make us a name, lest we be
scattered over all the earth.&quot; So what is wrong about people building a
city and a tower?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>According to
the plain reading of the verses, it seems that the Holy One, blessed be He,
fears Man's power and struggles with him for a position of power. Our Sages,
perhaps apprehensive of such a reading, assign covert motives to the tower
builders, such as sinning against god, idolatry, attempting to wage war against
the armies of heaven, and moral turpitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The most
mysterious explanation is that of the Ramban, who criticizes the builders' declaration
&quot;That we may make us a name&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>But one who
knows the meaning of &quot;name&quot; [<i>shem</i>], will understand that their
intent in saying &quot;we may make us a name&quot; - and will know the
dimensions of the intended tower, and will understand the entire matter, that
they have evil intentions and that their punishment was to be divided into
languages and countries, measure for measure, because they were 'mutilating the
roots&quot; [idiom for apostasy.]. Their sin was similar to that of their
father, and perhaps that is the reason our Sages homiletically expounded <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit Rabba 38:9</span>): 'which humans built' -
Said R' Berechia, [Had the Torah not informed us that humans had built it, what
would we have said] &quot;Did asses build it? Did camels build it? [Of course
we would have known] that early man had built it, etc&quot; Note that in the
flood narrative, the Lord is referred to as &quot;Elohim&quot;, but in the
Tower of Babel story, His unique name, the <span style='color:black'>Tetragrammaton,
is used; this is because the flood was <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>[punishment]
for corrupting the earth, but the division [into nations and languages] was
because <b>they mutilated the roots, </b>and they are punished in His great
name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton], and this the reason for His 'going down' and
similarly in the Sodom narrative. And the wise will comprehend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Ramban's words
are not clear. What is the meaning of &quot;mutilating the roots&quot; and in
what way is one who constructs towers 'a mutilator of roots'? Ramban compares
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> to Man's original sin. According
to the Midrash Rabba, the reason given in the Tower narrative is &quot;that
they built people&quot; [translator's note: The Hebrew text <i>Asher banu bnei
adam</i> - usually translated &quot;which men built&quot;, may also be read &quot;that
they built men&quot;]. This is the similarity between their transgression and
that of Adam, the first man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Reading the
texts, we note like structures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><b>The first
man: &quot;</b>And the Lord God said - <b>Now</b> that the human has become
like <b>one</b> of us, knowing good and evil, <b>and now</b> may reach out and
take as well from the tree of life and live forever&quot;. And the Lord God <b>sent
him</b> from the garden of Eden to till the soil from which he had been taken.&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit 3:22-23)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on"><b>Tower</b></st1:PlaceType><b> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></b></st1:place>:<b> </b>And the Lord God said,
&quot;<b>And now they </b>are <b>one</b> people with one language for all, if
this is what they have begun to do, <b>now</b> nothing they plot to do will
elude them. . . And the Lord <b>scattered them</b> from there over all the
earth and they left off building the city&quot;. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit
11:6-7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Just as in the
case of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, so in the story
of the first man is it difficult to understand God's apprehension. Can Man
really &quot;be like one of us&quot;? Is it conceivable that &quot;nothing they
plot to do will elude them&quot;? Adam's disobedience of God (for which he was
already punished) aside, what is so wrong with knowing good and evil as to
warrant expulsion from the garden of Eden? In both stories there does not seem
to be any essential flaw in man's actions - knowing good and bad, and building
a city and a tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Despite this,
the Ramban sees these as &quot;mutilating the roots&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The term &quot;mutilating
the roots&quot; links us to another figure, the Tanna Elisha ben Abuya, &quot;Acher&quot;,
who left the Torah world and was affiliated with the Romans. Tractate Hagiga
(14b), relates how Elisha entered the Garden and 'mutilated the roots'. This
act led to his distancing himself from Judaism and abandoning the Torah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>What did
Elisha do in the Garden? Many attempts were made to explain the processes which
caused Elisha to leave Judaism, some of them dealing with the meaning of &quot;Garden&quot;
as a designation of the mystic teachings and Kaballah. Another explanation
appears in the Talmud Yerushalmi's critique <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Hagiga
9b</span>) of Elisha's father, who wanted to benefit from the power of the
Torah and therefore sanctified his son to Torah study - &quot;Because his
intent was not for the sake of heaven, therefore it [Torah] did not last in
that person&quot;. It may be that Elisha strove, like his father, to discover
simple and speedy mystic solutions to achieve high status. Instead of acting &quot;for
the sake of heaven&quot; he acted for personal gain. He did not seek the dialogue
and discussion of the Bet Hamidrash, and instead of enriching society he
mutilated the variety of voices found therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>We return to
the Book of Bereishit - the first man and the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Babel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
These narratives belong to the infrastructure of the Creation, the basis of
human existence. Such being the case, perhaps we should exchange our
understanding of the concept of 'sin' in its specific sense, for a new and
wider perception of the essence of man in the world and his commitment which
derives from that perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Rav Avrhaham
Yitzchak HaCohen Kook, in his theological approach, presented the goal of the
world as an ongoing process <b>of self-perfection</b> of the <b>perfect</b>
divinity. In his opinion, the existence of God is perfect, but in order to be
perfect, there is also need for an ongoing process of self-perfection - for
constant betterment. To fulfill this need, He created the world - that
self-perfecting component, which constantly attempts to advance:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt'>What do we think of the Divine's goal
in founding existence? We say that the absolute perfection is inevitable,
nothing in it is potential, all is actual fact. But there is the perfection of
adding perfection, which cannot be part of the Divinity, for the infinite
absolute perfection leaves no room for addition. Towards this end - that also
the addition of perfection not be lacking in existence - the universal
existence must be in a process of becoming, beginning, according to <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>this, from the lowest possible nadir,
that is to say, from a status of absolute absence, and constantly progressing
toward the absolute apex. Existence was created with this feature so that it
never cease from ascending, for this is an infinite action...<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> (Rav Kook, Shmoneh Kvatzim I, 443)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>'Mutilation of
the roots' is simply damaging the growth of the world. The world was created to
grow, to continue to perfect itself, to blossom forever. The search for
shortcuts stunts the plants. This is what Elisha ben Abuya did when he entered
the Garden in search of shortcuts to fame. The first man and the builders of
the Tower also mutilated the plants and endeavored to find shortcuts to the
goal, forgoing the path. If the first man will eat from the Tree of Life, he
will be perfect, thus leaving him with no mission in the world. The people of
the Tower of Babel would cut themselves off from the world, would forgo growth,
would try to reach the peak, the goal, without developing the new world about

people were to found scattered up to the ends of the whole earth; there were
different tribes and different and very dissimilar languages. These doubts were
put to an end through an exposition of the genealogy of all of them and of
their branching by mentioning the names of the famous men among them - such and
