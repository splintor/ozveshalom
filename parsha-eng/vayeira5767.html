stand against him as the many and the established against the individual and
the different. They are the veteran establishment standing against the new and
unknown.</p>

At first glance, this dictum seems strange. It appears to describe a normal
society in which individuals see to their own affairs, and that is indeed the
main opinion recorded by the Mishnah. However, a society in which individuals
remains isolated in their own private sphere, dismissing any obligations
towards their neighbors (not to speak of obligations towards strangers!) is a
negative and dangerous society. The<span dir=RTL></span><span dir=RTL><span

It is a nostalgic stance that pines for the past and which is incapable of
dealing with future difficulties. Her beloved past was no garden of roses. <st1:City><st1:place>Sodom</st1:place></st1:City>
was a threatening environment, and its social mechanisms had never accepted <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>'s
family. Nevertheless, when the time came to leave, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>'s

which she could not disconnect. She remains in her stance to this very day.</p>

and despite the fact that the older daughter's resulting son was Moav, the
ancestor of Ruth and of King David by way of Ruth (and, according to tradition,
the ancestor of the Messiah by way of David), their stance reflects a sick
society which has abolished the prohibition on incest,; this constitutes an
abolition of the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><st1:place>Lot</st1:place>'s

they decide to willfully transgress one of the most serious prohibition of our
culture and of the other cultures of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>This kind of
existential fear overturns all the rules, including categorical rules, and it
also poses a psychological and societal danger. Prophets of doom (whether from

<st1:place>Lot</st1:place>'s stance is no stance at all. There he slouches
drunk on wine, choosing not to know what his daughters are doing to him. While
they are motivated towards drastic action by fear and concern for the
inhabitation of the world, it is difficult to show any understanding for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>'s
own choice. If this father failed to protect his daughter when he was not &quot;as
drunk as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>,&quot; he can be trusted not to display
responsibility when inebriated. While the Sages offer round-about praise for
the daughters' actions, they have nothing but harsh rebuke for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>)</span> - Abraham does not flinch, he does not lower
his eyes, he does not equivocate. Abraham is even prepared to behave in a
manner that appears disrespectful when he stands before his God. He is a
committed person, <i>mit'hayev b'nafsho</i> [&quot;mortally committed&quot;],
his stance is one of reverence, but also of dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The Holy One
blessed be He is responsiveness to Abraham. He demonstrates His pleasure with
Abraham's assuming the stance of a subject standing in awe and faith, looking
his Creator &quot;straight in the eye.&quot; The Talmud tells us in the name of
the Amora Rav: &quot;One who prays - when he bows, he bows at the word <i>barukh</i>
[blessed], and when he straightens up, he straightens up when uttering the Name
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Berakhot 12a)</span>. We are to learn from this
that when we stand before our Creator, we must comport ourselves with holiness
and awe, but not with abnegation and servility. God Himself seeks a
relationship of dialogue rather than mere submission from His creatures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>R. Simon
presents an even more extreme proof of Abraham's steadfastness: &quot;This is a
scribal emendation; the Divine Presence waited for Abraham [rather than
vice-versa, as described in our text of the Torah].&quot;<sup>4</sup> According
to this, it was not Abraham who stood before God, but rather God who stood
before Abraham. These strong words can teach us that God is not only willing to
sometimes &quot;stand&quot; before humans when they are deserving, but that He
is prepared to change His mind when faced with the correctness of their human
stance.</p>

taken in the face of crisis - four and one more: there are those who refuse to
accept the other, the one who cannot leave the past behind, those who have
completely abandoned past restraints and act out of complete insecurity
regarding the future, and one who chooses not to know. Abraham's stance is
different and distinct - Abraham is the man of faith and the man of dialogue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The story of <st1:City><st1:place>Sodom</st1:place></st1:City>
teaches us that the proper stance to take on the continuum between past and
future, facing both self and community - is itself the proper stance to take
before God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Today the
children of Abraham are called upon to be prepared to assume the courageous
stance of Abraham of old. The stance has nothing to do with bent necks and
abnegation; it is all courage and faith. The proper stance of those towards
those, in steadfastness and dignity is also the proper stance of faith. May the
Holy One blessed be He look into our hearts and respond to that stance!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Turning the Other Cheek - A Jewish Notion? <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>While relating to the question, &quot;Is
there a Jewish morality?&quot; - against the background of things heard in the
course of the past several weeks regarding a Jewish morality of revenge versus
a Christian morality of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; - Shemuel Herr
writes that there is only one morality, neither Jewish nor Christian, and that,
&quot;the idea of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; is actually a distinctly
Jewish notion.&quot; The author even brings citations from Scripture and the
writings of the Sages to substantiate his thesis. He quotes the verse from
Isaiah <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(50:6)</span>: <i>I offered my back to
the floggers and my cheeks to those who tore out my hair. I did not hide my
face from insult and spittle</i> and from Lamentations <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(</span><st1:time Minute="29" Hour="3"><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>3:29</span></st1:time><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>)</span>: <i>He offers his cheek to those who strike
him, satiated with humiliation</i>. The author sees the verse from Lamentations
as expressing the virtues befitting a man. He brings a number of sources from
the Sages, such as, &quot;A person should always belong to the pursued and not
to the pursuers&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bava Kama 93a)</span>,
and the Gemara in Gittin <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(36b)</span>, which
praises &quot;those who suffer insult but do not insult.&quot;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In my humble opinion, the author
is mixing up things that do not belong together. The statements referring to
Jewish morality to which the author alludes in the beginning of his article and
that I have mentioned above refer to the Jewish morality of <b>warfare</b>. However,
the biblical and rabbinical sources which he cites in the continuation of his
article do not relate at all to the Jewish morality of warfare but rather to
the <b>proper relations between man and God and between man and his fellow</b>,
which has nothing to do with the morality of warfare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Take, for example, the verse from
Isaiah mentioned above, in which the prophet, who has gone of on a mission from
God to preach to the People Israel, is not deterred by those who strike him,
spit at him, or humiliate him. Can we extrapolate from this the proper way to
relate to <b>enemies in the midst of battle!? </b>It is most important to
mention, that in prophesizing about God's war against <st1:country-region><st1:place>Edom</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the prophet Isaiah speaks explicitly about <b>vengeance</b>: <i>For a day of
vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redemption has arrived</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(63:4)</span>. Here the prophet alludes to the verse
from <i>Ha'azinu</i>:<i> Vengeance is poised with Me, and it will pay</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Devarim 32:35)</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>As for the verse from
Lamentations: here the prophet is saying that a man must lovingly accept the
troubles that come from God and not complain against God. Is this a moral
instruction given to a <b>soldier going off to battle</b>, that when standing
before the enemy which is trying to destroy him, he should turn the other
cheek!?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The quotes that the author brings
from the Sages do not relate to the morality of warfare either. Rather, they
are lessons that one should apply to one's interactions with human beings: to
be humble, to be among those who are insulted but not among those who insult,
etc. Is this instruction directed to a <b>soldier in battle!?</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Torah's instruction to
soldiers going off to battle is not &quot;turn the other cheek,&quot; but
rather: &quot;<a name="OLE_LINK2">He who rises to kill you - rise up earlier to
kill him</a>.&quot; As the midrash <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bamidbar
Rabbah, 21)</span> puts it: &quot;<i>Assail the Midianites</i> - Why? <i>For
they assail you</i>. From here the Sages said: 'He who rises to kill you - rise
up earlier to kill him.'&quot; True, the Torah's command to fight is
accompanied by moral commandments, such as: the call for peace, the prohibition
against wanton destruction, etc. <a name="OLE_LINK3">However, as for combat
itself - the goal is to destroy the enemy and the ultimate consideration is how
to beat the enemy while suffering a minimum of casualties.</a> As for one who
does not act in accordance with these criteria and instead takes pity on the
lives of our enemies who rise up to destroy us - even paying with the lives of
our fighters - of him it has been said, &quot;Anyone who becomes merciful
towards the cruel shall eventually become cruel towards the merciful&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tanhuma, Metzora 1)</span>, and as the RaMBaM put it:
&quot;Mercy towards the wicked is cruelty towards people in general&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> 3:39)</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A Response to the Response by the author of the article,
Shemuel Herr<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>My thanks<b> </b>to Prof.
Shochetman who points out to me that the way a person comports himself in his
home with his family and friends - or even with people who happens upon in the
marketplace - is unlike the way he comports himself towards his enemies who
rise up to kill him; even more so when he is a soldier protecting his people
and homeland in battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>He is also correct in pointing
out that the context in which I made my statements could lead people to <b>misunderstand</b>
them, as if I meant to say that the Sages intended to be offering &quot;instruction
directed to a soldier in battle.&quot; That, however, is not the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The above is also true regarding
the famous verses from Christian scripture. They too were never directed
towards soldiers in the battlefield or to enemies that rise up to kill you, but
rather towards the <i>sonei</i> [<i>enemy</i>] in the sense given that term in
the laws of returning lost property found in the book of Shemot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The writer is also correct when
he states that &quot;the Torah's command to fight is accompanied by moral
commandments,&quot; but I am not sure that I understand the sentence - &quot;However,
as for combat itself - the goal is to destroy the enemy and the ultimate
consideration is how to beat the enemy while suffering a minimum of casualties.&quot;
It is well known that modern warfare gives rise to difficult and complicated
ethical questions. Who is enemy being referred to? Are civilians included? What
of women and children? What of civilians who serve as hostages in the hands of
the &quot;terrorists&quot;? Can the explication of the verse about the
Midianites supply us with answers to these difficult questions? I wonder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Here is the place to state that
the Torah lacks any kind of tidy doctrine of &quot;military ethics&quot;; all
of these issues are treated by the Sages in widely dispersed bits of Scriptural
exegesis (of many passages containing few laws) - in contrast to what some
scholars of recent times have imagined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>To tell the truth, I did not
really intend my article to treat the war itself, but rather the discourse that
came in its wake. I think that I disagree with Prof. Shochetman's assessment of
the significance of that discourse. In my humble opinion, its significance is
much broader than just talk about war and the ethics of warfare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The distinction between &quot;Jewish&quot;
and &quot;Christian&quot; morality finds its significance both in anti-Semitic
discourse, and, paradoxically, in certain rabbinical discourse which claims
that the God of Israel and the morality of Israel has no truck with human
morality; rather - allegedly - they have a special morality, as the wicked
Balaam said, <i>a nation that dwells alone and pays no attention to the nations</i>.
My words were directed solely against such notions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>In the end of the first section
of his <i>Kuzari</i>, R. Yehudah HaLevi mentions the New Testament verse about &quot;turning
the other cheek&quot; as proof of the praise deserved by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for being the humblest of nations. The King of Khazar answers that this is no
reason for praise, because that condition is forced upon them; &quot;When they
find themselves able, they [too] shall kill.&quot; The Scholar answers: &quot;You
have found the place of my disgrace, O King of Khazar.&quot; </p>

movement dedicated to the advancement of a civil society in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

concepts that have always been central to Jewish tradition and law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom shares
a deep attachment to the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>land</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName>Israel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
and it no less views peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews
have both the religious and the national obligation to support the pursuit of
peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and
just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but
an imperative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>5,000 copies of a 4 page peace
oriented commentary on the weekly Torah reading are written and published by Oz

furthering of peace and coexistence, the movement is in a unique position to
engage in dialogue with the secular left and the religious right, with Israeli
