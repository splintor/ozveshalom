<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"These are the appointed times of God, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness, for these are they, my appointed times."</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">" . . . the appointed times of God, which you are to proclaim . . ." &ndash; </I>determined by us in the name of heaven.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>A gentile asked Rabbi Akiva, saying to him: Why do you establish appointed times? Does not The Holy One, Blessed Be He, say to you: "<I>Your new moons and your appointed times fill Me with loathing!?" </I>(Isaiah 1:14). Said Rabbi Akiva: If He had said: "<U>My</U> new moons and <U>my</U> appointed times" I would say so [that you have a case]; but He said, "<I><U>Your</U> new moons and <U>your</U> appointed times" &ndash; </I>referring to those appointed times established by Jeroboam, as is written "<I>And Jeroboam established a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month; in imitation of the festival in Judah, he established on at Bethel, and he ascended the altar [there]. . . .he had contrived of his own mind to establish a festival for the Israelites . . ." </I>(II Kings 12:32,33). But <B>these appointed times</B> will never be abolished, nor the New-Moons. Why? Because they were established by <B>The Holy One, Blessed Be He, </B>as is written "<I>These are the appointed times of God" </I>(Vayikra 23:4). And it is also written "<I>So Moshe declared the appointed times of God to the children of Israel." </I>(Ibid. ibid. 44) therefore <B>they will never be abolished. </B>And regarding them is it said: "<I>Well-founded for all eternity, wrought of truth and equity." &#9;&#9;&#9;</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"These are the appointed times of God, which you are to proclaim . . ." </I>&ndash; Whether they occur in their proper time or not, I have no appointed times other than these. Said The Holy One, Blessed Be He, to Israel: "In the past they were in <B>my hands</B><I>, </I>as is written (Tehillim 104:19), <I>'He created the moon for the appointed times,' </I>but from here on, they are in your hands, in your authority; if you say 'yes' -- then yes; if you say 'no' &ndash; then no. In any case, the [determination of] the month is yours. Yet more, should you desire to intercalate the year, I will acquiesce, there for is it written: '<I>Let this New-moon be for <B>you</B> the beginning of New-moons.'</I> &#9;<I>(Shemot Rabba 15)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proclamation of the Appointed Times</P>
</B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The parasha of the appointed times [the festivals] appears in four more places in the Torah. Only in Parashat Emor, however, is there emphasis upon the <B>proclaiming of the appointed times. </B>As against the commandments <I>"Observe the Festival of the Matzot</I>" or "<I>Observe the month of the aviv</I>" which appear in Parashat Mishpatim, Ki Tissa, and Re'eh, "proclaim-proclamation" appears in our parasha four times:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"</FONT><B>These are the appointed times of God, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"These are the appointed times of God, proclamations of holiness, which you are to proclaim them at their appointed-times"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"And you are to make-proclamation on that same day, a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"These are the appointed-times of God, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">True, the term "<I>proclamation of holiness" </I>does appear in Parashat Pinhas, but the <U>command to proclaim</U> appears only here, in Emor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to our Sages, one of the meanings of 'proclaiming the appointed-times' is the <I>kiddush hahodesh -- </I>sanctification of the New-moon -- which serves as the basis for determining when the festivals occur. </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been taught </B>[in a berayta]: <B>How is the New-moon sanctified? The head of the Bet Din says "Sanctified" &ndash; and all the nation repeats after him, "Sanctified, sanctified!". What is the [</B>scriptural] <B>source for this? Said Rav Papa: For it is written: "<I>Which you are to proclaim them" </I>-- read not "<I>otam</I>" [them] but rather "<I>atem" </B></I>[you]. (Bavli, Rosh Hashana 24a)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;According to Rav Papa's interpretation, the phrase <I>"which you are to proclaim them [otam]" </I>which<I> </I>appears three times in the parasha, refers not to the festivals, but to the Children of Israel [<I>atem &ndash; </I>you]. The word <I>otam/atem </I>is not the object of the sentence, but its subject. Therefore, according to the midrash, the vowels of the of the word <I>aleph-tav-mem</I>, are not <I>holem-patah</I>, but <I>patah-segol</I>. The obligation of proclaiming the appointed-times is upon <B>you</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Proclamation of the appointed times, i.e., determination of the date of the festival, is the obligation of the entire community. Therefore, the parashat ha'moadot, the chapter of festivals, begins with:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>God spoke to Moshe, saying: Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: The appointed-times of God, which you are to proclaim them proclamations of holiness . . ."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the Children of Israel who are addressed here, not the priests to whom the parasha's preceding commands were directed. The Ramban noticed this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The priests have no more say than do the Children of Israel in proclamation of appointed times, and therefore, the parasha makes no mention of Aharon and his sons &ndash; only the Children of Israel. (Ramban, Commentary on the Torah, "Speak to the Children of Israel").</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Authority of the Sages</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Our Sages record that the day on which festivals were to fall was determined by the bet Din, acting as representatives of the community. They saw the Bet Din having almost absolute authority to determine the festival. In the famous polemic between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua on the Sanctification of the New-Moon, Rabbi Akiva attempts to convince Rabbi Yehoshua to accept Rabban Gamliel's authority, saying:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can derive from scripture that whatever Rabban Gamliel rules is law, for it says, <B><I>"These are the appointed-times of God, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness" &ndash; </B></I>whether they do &ndash; or do not &ndash; fall on the proper day, I have no appointed-times other than these. (Mishna, Rosh Hashana 2:8)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rabbi Akiva's argument can be understood on a number of levels. First of all, on the practical level. There can be no preservation of national unity if there are differences of opinion regarding the calendar. Almost all sects which broke away from the Jewish nation adopted a new calendar. That Bet Shamai and Bet Hillel succeeded in sustaining unity among themselves despite different opinions on critical issues, can be attributed in large part to their acceptance of a common calendar. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, one can discern here a modern conception of time. Time is not absolute; time is relative. According to the Theory of Relativity, for example, different observers are able to measure different times for a single process. Surprisingly, we find here a similar perception. The clock which measures time, the month or the year, is not absolute, but is dependent upon the observer, who is able to influence the time which he is measuring. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a deeper level, the power of the Bet Din to decide festival dates expresses an understanding of Israel's standing before God.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Said Rabbi Krispai in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: In the past &ndash; "<I>These are the appointed times of God"; </I>from now on &ndash; "<I>which you shall proclaim them."</B> </I>(Yerushalmi, Rosh Hashana, Chap. 1, Halacha 3)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exclusive authority to schedule festivals was put into the hands of Israel. Like in the case of "Tanur Achnai" we find amazing theological audacity on Rabbi Yochanan's part. He takes the Almighty, as it were, out of the game. God laid down the rules, and assigned authority. From then on, it is for the Bet Din to decide. The same Rabbi Yochanan teaches elsewhere:</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Said Rabbi Yochanan: "When the ministering angels gather before The Holy One, Blessed Be He, to ask when are Rosh Hashanah and Yom HaKippurim, The Holy One, Blessed Be He, replies: "You are asking me?" Let us go together to the Bet Din below."</B> (Devarim Rabba, 2:14)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Appointed-times and the Shabbat</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>In contrast to the appointed times, determination of the Shabbat is not within the jurisdiction of the Sages. The weekly cycle, with the Shabbat at its center, continues to revolve independently of any decision by Bet Din. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In qualified contradiction to the above, the chapter of appointed-times in our parasha opens with the Shabbat:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>For six days may work be done, but on the seventh day is Shabbat Shabbaton (Shabbat, Sabbath-Ceasing). . ."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>Many have discussed this matter. Our Sages sthe problem. Regarding the final passage in the festival chapter -- which tells us that<B>: "<I>So Moshe declared the appointed-times of God to the Children of Israel"</B> &ndash; </I>our Sages offer a daring explication, saying:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is taught [in a berayta]: "<I>The appointed-times of God" </I>are presented; the Sabbath of Bereishit, of Genesis, is not included. [This teaches us that] "<I>the appointed-times of God" </I>require sanctification [by Bet Din]; Shabbat Bereishit does not require sanctification by Bet Din. </B>(Bavli, Nedarim 78a)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This is to say that even though the Shabbat was included in the festival chapter, its determination was not given over by Moshe to the jurisdiction of Israel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Another explanation, almost Hassidic in nature, was offered by the Gaon of Vilna. The Shabbat mentioned in our parasha is not Shabbat Bereishit &ndash; Shabbat of Creation -- but Yom Kippur. According to this understanding, the passage <B>"<I>For six days may work be done, but on the seventh day is Shabbat, Shabbat-Ceasing" </B></I>does not refer to the days of the week, but rather sums up the festival days which are the subject of the parasha &ndash; first and last days of Pesach, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, first day of Sukkot, and Shmini Atzeret. On six of these seven days, some work -- preparation of food -- is permitted; only on one &ndash; Yom Kippur &ndash; is work totally forbidden.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elaborating upon the difference between Shabbat and festival, Rabbi Meir Shimha of Dvinsk wrote in his "Meshekh Hokhma":</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Know, that the Divine law contains mitzvoth which connect between Israel and their Father in Heaven, and there are those which connect Jews to each other. For example &ndash; tsitsit, tephillin, and mezuza are mitzvot which bind Jews to The Holy One, Blessed Be He; kind deeds, terumoth and tithes bind Jews to each other. Similar to this is the relation of Shabbat to Yom Tov. On Shabbat "Let no man leave his place" . . . each man, then, sits alone and studies the Torah. All Jews are tied to The Holy One, Blessed Be He, the true center. All Israel are separate lines which reach a single focal point - The Holy One, Blessed Be He. Yom Tov, however, is one of the mitzvot which connect all members of the nation to each other . . . all are charged to go up [to Yerushalayim] on pilgrimage, to rejoice and to make others happy. Therefore, taking out [objects from private to public domain] and transfer of fire are permitted; otherwise, Jews would not be connected and united with each other.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National Function of the Festivals</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unification of the nation, in the terminology of the Meshekh Hokhma, is accomplished by preservation of the collective memory of those events which are the foundation of the national consciousness. It is one of the main functions of the festivals. </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Keep the New-Moon of Aviv [ripe-grain] . . . for in the New-Moon of Aviv, the Lord your God took you out of Egypt . . ."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">". . . in order that your generations may know that in huts I had the Children of Israel stay when I brought them out of the land of Egypt."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The natural world in which we live is cyclic; it is ordered by cycles of sunrise and sunset, sowing and reaping, flowering and wilting, birth and death. Everything is erased and forgotten, only to be created anew. "<B><I>The earlier ones are not remembered" &ndash;</B></I> concluded Kohellet in his pessimistic vein. The festivals, markers on a time spectrum, are weapons in the battle against forgetfulness and for identity. They preserve the national memory within the nature cycle, giving our lives meaning, purpose, and hope.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the centrality of the festival to national consciousness and experience, it is proper that Israel and its representatives be the agency for determining the time of their observance. But the festivals, as molders and preservers of the national identity, do not include the Shabbat. Those ideas represented by the Shabbat contain a cosmic and universal dimension, coming down to us from Creation &ndash; "<B><I>. . . and He rested on the seventh day from all the work . . ." -- </B></I>which extends beyond the narrow national dimension. Shabbat predated those events which formed our national identity by many generations, and is therefore not determined by Israel. On festivals which occur on Shabbat, we recite "<B>Who sanctifies the Shabbat and Israel and the festivals". </B>First of all, the Shabbat, after that Israel, and -- only at the end -- the festivals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;And, finally, it is important to remember that national identity is expressed not only via the collective memory, but also by shared responsibility. In the festival chapter, the Torah commands us:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B><I>Now, when you harvest the harvest of your land, you are not to finish-off the edge of your field when you harvest it, the full-gleaning of your harvest you are not to glean; for the afflicted and for the sojourner you are to leave them, I am the Lord your God!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The poor and the stranger are part of you. The festival cannot be perfect if there is no concern for the weaker sectors of society. Therefore, the Rambam rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Better that one increase gifts to the poor than to increase his own dining and the sending of portions to his friends; there is no greater and more glorious joy than to rejoice the hearts of the indigent, the orphans, the widows, and strangers. (Yad HaHazakkah, Laws of Megillah, 2:7)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Appointed-time is a normal day which the consciousness of the Jewish people transmutes into a festival day. This is the simple meaning of <I>mikra kodesh &ndash; '</I>a proclamation of holiness' &ndash; a day which is transformed into holiness by public proclamation. The festival is not created without partnership, and, mainly, without public responsibility. If this not be the case, how will the individual components of the nation be connected and bound to each other?</P><DIR>

About us</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was founded in 1975 in order to present an alternative expression of religious Zionism. It is committed to promoting the ideals of tolerance, pluralism, and justice, concepts which have always been centrato Jewish tradition and law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was established by a group of awho were alarmed by the growing militance which they saw in most of the religious Zionist community. They were aware that religious fundamentalism, gaining hold throughout the region, mounted the greatest threat to possible coexistence, and believed that the only effective counter arguments would also need to stem from religious tradition. They were convinced that the established religious Zionist camp had become distanced from the values which had originally been its cornerstones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom shares a powerful attachment to the land of Israel and nevertheless views peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews have a religious obligation no less than a national one to support the pursuit of peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but an imperative.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s programs include both educational and protest activities. Seminars, lectures, workshops, conferences and weekend programs on a variety of topics are held for youth, students, educators and families, while protest activities focus on issues of human rights, co-existence between Jews and Arabs, and responses to issues of particular religious relevance. We publish 9,000 copies of a 4 page peace oriented commentary on the weekly Torah reading that is distributed to over 350 synagogues in Israel and is sent overseas via email.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s educational forums attract not only religious Israelis, but also secular people who are keen to deepen their Jewish knowledge and to hear an alternative religious standpoint on the subjects of peace and social issues. In many respects, therefore, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom fills the ideological vacuum which has been created and counteracts the stridency which is emerging in the right-wing community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committed to Jewish tradition and law, while supporting peace, equality and co-existence, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom is in a unique position to enter into a dialogue with both the secular left and the religious right.</P>
