<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>The sign and its meaning are told us, about that there can be no doubt.
It only remains to consider the connection between the sign and its
signification. This has been attempted in various ways. The sign is a reversed
weapon, a bow with the string towards the earth, so that it would shoot away
from the earth, accordingly a sign of peace, no more arrows from heaven. Its
appearance is that of an arc joining the earth to heaven, accordingly a bond
between heaven and earth. The phenomenon itself is woven from light and water.
In the midst of overcast threatening clouds it announces the presence of light,
is accordingly a reminder that in the midst of God's threatened wrath His preserving
grace is still there. But perhaps still the light of the colors of the rainbow
is in closer relation than all these ideas. By it our attention would
repeatedly be directed to the fact that, in spite of all differences in the
degree of human development, God would never again decree the downfall of the
whole human race, but that its future education to its godly purpose was to be
founded just on these differences and varieties of humanity. For is the rainbow
anything else but the pure complete ray of light, broken up into seven degrees
of seven colors, from the red rays nearest to the light to the violet, most
distant from the light, losing itself into the darkness; and from the one to
the other are they not all rays of light, and combined together, do they not
form the one complete pure white ray?<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Humanity's corruption reached intolerable
depths and God decided to destroy it and begin anew. Noah, the generation's
lone <i>tzaddik</i> [righteous person] was chosen to father the next stage of
the human race. Twice the Torah describes him as a tzaddik in his generation. <i>Noah
was a righteous man he was perfect in his generations</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(6:9)</span>, and <i>for it is you that I have seen as
a righteous man before Me in this generation</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(7:1)</span>.
The emphasis on Noah's &quot;generation&quot; generated a disagreement amongst
the classical exegetes: No one can remain untouched by the influence of his
generation. Does the fact that Noah was a tzaddik in the context of a generation
so morally corrupt that it deserved extermination improve or degrade his
standing? On the one hand, Noah deserves praise for managing to preserve his
inner divine image and raising himself up above the terrible standards of his
generation. On the other hand, Noah may have been a rather ordinary person
whose relative righteousness only became noticeable against the lurid backdrop
of his corrupt generation. If he had lived in a righteous era, no one would
have taken notice of him. Those who downgrade Noah compare him to Abraham. Regarding
Noah, it is written: <i>Noah walked with God</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(6:9)</span>,
while regarding Abraham it is written: <i>Walk before Me and be perfect</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(17:1)</span>. One who walks <b>before</b> God and
lights the way for all with his deeds and the power of his personality is
greater than one who walks at God's side, being led and activated from outside.
Two facts reflect this difference between Noah and Abraham:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>1) God maintain a steady dialogue with
Abraham across years in which Abraham takes an active part, while Noah only
hears a divine monologue; he remains passive and does not actually participate
in a conversation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>2) When Noah hears that God plans the total
destruction of His creation - save two representatives, a male and a female of
each species - he does not respond. Following in the footsteps of his
predecessors, Adam and Cain, he takes no responsibility upon himself; he does
not attempt to challenge the terrible decree. When Abraham, in contrast, hears
that God plans to annihilate the populations of Sodom and Gomorrah, he takes on
responsibility and tries to have the decree annulled. He does not hesitate to
stand before God's presence and suggest that Divine justice may have erred. It
is only when Abraham faces a personal trial with the binding of Isaac that he
demonstrates full trust in Divine justice and forwards no appeal. This reflects
the difference between Noah and Enoch <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(5:22)</span>
on the one hand and the Patriarchs on the other, as Jacob puts it: <i>The God
before Whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, walked</i> <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(28:15)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>It is worth mentioning that
&quot;righteousness&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; [<i>emunah</i>] have a
different meaning in Scripture than they do in the language of the Sages. A
tzaddik is not someone who retires from this world and spends his days in the
worship of God and in efforts to cleave to God; rather, he is a person who is
found blameless before God's judgment. He is someone who walks the straight
path through the world. &quot;Faith&quot; does not refer to a deep but
rationally unsupported belief in the existence of God. Rather, the person of
faith is certain that God will keep his promises, or he is a faithful man,
someone honest who does justice. As is the case with all of the Bible's
tzaddikim, Noah's righteousness and perfection [<i>temimut</i>] refer to his
morality and honesty towards others in the context of a generation plagued with
corruption, violence, and theft; it does not refer to the degree of his
religious connection with God. The Torah's description of Abraham - <i>And he
believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him as righteousness</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(15:6)</span> - must also be properly understood. It
tells us that despite his old age and the old age of Sarah, Abraham trusted in
God's promise of children, and that God counted that faith to his merit. <i>Walk
before Me and be perfect</i> (17:1) - walk in the straight path. <i>Will You
also kill a righteous people?</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(20:4)</span>
- will God kill blameless peoples who are not found guilty by divine judgment? <i>And
they believed in the Lord and in His servant Moses</i> <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(Shemot 14:31)</span> - Israel was sure that the promises made by God
and His servant Moses would be fulfilled; we are not told that they believed in
the very existence of God and Moses, since they saw Moses alive and in action
before their own eyes! <i>So he was with his hands in faith until sunset</i> <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot 17:12)</span> - Moses hands were straight and
erect. <i>A tzaddik lives in his faith</i> - <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Habakkuk
2:4)</span> - not as in the Christian interpretation, that the tzaddik lives by
merit of his faith (in Jesus' divinity) and by his tenacity in that faith, but
rather that the tzaddik will live thanks to his being a man who trusts God, who
is faithful, honest, and just.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Modern interpretations view the first two
parshiyot of Bereishit as describing a series of divine &quot;attempts&quot;
whose purpose is to teach the reader a moral lesson. The first attempt in the
Garden of Eden failed. The second attempt to grant humanity an opportunity to
come to recognize the one God by its own efforts and to establish the kind of
moral life necessary for the survival of society - also failed. People strayed
after their low, sensual, and material aspect, ending with the Flood and their
total annihilation. The third attempt, that of the &quot;Generation of the
Dispersal&quot; which followed Noah, also failed. They tried to develop
humanity without Divine instruction by canceling the value of the individual
and the harnessing of all energies to societal despotism in order to promote
national honor through ideological and linguistic homogeneity. Man had chosen
to develop his unique qualities in an arrogant and despotic fashion, viewing
the state and the nation as ends in themselves, rather than as instruments for
the welfare of individuals. In reaction, God dispersed the people of that
generation and confused their language, thus ending their race after collective
glory. God prevented homogeneity and totalitarian centralism and allowed for
subjectivity and differentiation which require the existence of a diversity of
opinion, struggles and efforts which lend meaning to human existence from which
truth arises in extended dialectical processes.<sup>2</sup> The colors of the
rainbow symbolize the diversity which ensures human development and from this
point forward it serves as a sign of how diversity protects life on earth from
a further deluge. Descriptions of these first three attempts come to teach the
reader the biblical point of view according to which man is the source of evil.
Man was born with the freedom to choose good or evil actions; he is free to
err, to be neglectful, or to scheme as he wishes. He can be lazy, stupid, or
wicked. All these can occur when he becomes trapped in the nets of pride,
avarice, or lust. Evil exists in the created world in order that good be
distinguishable from it; this is the best of all possible worlds. A world
without evil or suffering is a world without challenges, without lessons or
reward; it is an empty world. All through human history and unto our own days
is has become clear that man requires God's direction towards the good,
otherwise he will have difficulty recognizing it; it will be hard for him to
aspire to the good, to persist in goodness and to succeed in it. From this
point on it is Scripture's purpose to guide the reader towards the good in a
newly chosen path involving the establishment of a unique people who will
undertake this special mission to humanity. From here on begins the explanation
of the People Israel's place within human society and how it began on its
journey in the world on the behalf of all humanity.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Post-modern Jewish interpretation is more
modest. From here on Scripture will give us the narrative of the People Israel,
how it began its way among the more similar and less similar narratives that
existed in the ancient Fertile Crescent region. These narratives developed
together in parallel with the course of history. This postmodern interpretation
views the various narratives from a pluralistic standpoint, allowing each to
tell the truth of its community, without necessarily undermining the holiness
of the biblical narrative for those whose consciousness developed under its
influence and who are committed to the norms that grew up within it.</p>

that they would come, two of each, on their own; he would not have to hunt them
in the mountains and on the islands. Then he would later bring them into the

rule. Afterwards, He commanded that Noah take of every clean animal seven of
each; in this case He did not say that they would come on their own, but that
Noah should take them, for those who come to be saved and to preserve their
seed arrive on their own, but He did not decree that those who come in order to
be offered as sacrifices should arrive on their own to be slaughtered, but rather
Noah took them, for the command of seven of each was so that Noah be able to
use them for sacrifices.</p>

He told her: From Noah - I wanted to enter the ark, but he refused to admit me

stipulate with you that all which I accumulate you may take. She listened to
him, and the two entered the ark. When they exited the ark, Falsehood went out

and said to her: Where is everything that I accumulated? She replied: Was this

…it appears to me that this decree (to scatter the Generation of the Dispersal)
was not a punishment, but rather a tremendous improvement on mankind's behalf.
The primary significance of the Tower of Babel narrative lies not in the
attempt to erect the tower, but in the preceding words: <i>All the earth</i> -
revived post Deluge mankind - <i>was of one language and the same words</i>. After
the construction failure, many languages evolved, and consequently, different <i>words</i>,
different ideas. It seems to me that the basis of the mistake, or sin, of the
Generation of the Dispersal, was not in the building of the city and the tower,
but in the movement to maintain, via these artificial means, the situation of <i>one
language and one set of words</i> - of centralization, which we, in modern
terms, call totalitarianism.</p>
