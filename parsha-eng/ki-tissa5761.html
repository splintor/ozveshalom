</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aharon's behavior when faced with the Children of Israel demanding "<I>a god who will lead us" </I>and his acquiescence in molding the calf, greatly disturbed our Sages and commentators. We will deal here with questions relating to Aharon's intent, his punishment or rewards, and the example he sets for us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Talmud Bavli, we read:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Said Rabbi Tanchum bar Hanilai: This passage [to be presented later on] refers to the making of the calf, as is written:  "<I>And</I> <I>Aharon saw and erected an altar before him" </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Shemot 32) </FONT>What did he see? Said Rabbi Binyamin  Yefet in the name of Rabbi Elazar: He saw Hur [his nephew] murdered before him. He said: "If I do not heed them, they will do to me as they did to Hur, and in me will be fulfilled  "<I>Priest and prophet are slain in the Sanctuary of the Lord" </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Eycha 2:20)  </FONT>and they will never have a remedy. Better that they worship the calf,  perhaps they will earn remedy through repentance.<FONT SIZE=2> (Sanhedrin 7a)</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The Talmud refers to another midrash, which has the Children of Israel asking Hur to fashion the calf before turning to Aharon:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Israel came before the elders and said . . . rise and make us a god who will lead us . . . upon hearing this, they said to them: "Why do you anger He who performed all those miracles and wonders for you?"  They did not listen, but they killed them. And when Hur stood before them and chastised them with harsh words, they rose up and killed him. All Israel came before Aharon with great ceremony, as is said: "<I>The people assembled against Aharon." </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Bemidbar Rabba (Vilna) Parasha 15, "Gather me").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hur, Aharon's nephew, who was appointed to lead the people together with him, refused to cooperate in the making of the calf, and was killed by them.  The contrast between the behavior of the two deepens the problem; how can it be that Aharon refused to die in sanctification of God's Name, after Hur had already done so? If  "Let him be killed, but not transgress" was justified in Hur's case  &ndash; at least so thought Hur --  should not Aharon  have refused to listen to the people and make the calf?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be remembered that Aharon was appointed High pries after the calf incident. This appointment would seem to be justified only if we assume that there was good reason for Aharon to make "a molten calf" &ndash; one of the severest of transgressions in the Torah.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Rabbi Elazar's opinion is that killing Aharon would constitute a sin so severe as to have no expiation; a terrible punishment would be given the people. Aharon's intent in forming the calf was to save the Jewish people from  calamity. Aharon concluded that he did not have the power to prevent the nation from sinning; he chose to cooperate in  order to minimize the calamity and punishment to be  meted out to the Children of Israel.     This intention is also evident in the following midrash:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>And Aharon saw" </I>&ndash; what did he see? Aharon said, "If they  make it, the transgression will be attributed to them. . . . better than the sin be attributed to me and not to Israel."  Rabbi Abba bar Yuden said in the name of Rabbi Abba: This may be compared to the son of a king who heart grew haughty, and took his sword to stab his father. Said his teacher to him, "Don't strain yourself; give me the sword and I will stab." The king looked at him and said to him: "I know what your intention was &ndash; better the shame be upon you than upon my son."&#9;&#9;&#9; (<FONT SIZE=2>VaYikra Rabba (Vilna) Paarasha 10;3 "Rabbi Berechia")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rav Zvi Hirsch Hayyot explains the above Gemorrah, in the light of the Rambam:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Even though there are sins more severe than murder, none is so destructive of civilization as is murder. Even idolatry, and needless to say, forbidden sexual relations or Shabbat desecration, are not to be compared to murder, for these sins belong to the category of  "between Man and God";  but bloodshed is a sin "between Man and Man", and whoever is guilty of this kind of transgression is a <I>rasha gamur- </I> an absolute scoundrel, and all of the positive mitzvoth which has done throughout his life cannot outweigh this transgression, and they will not save him from justice, as is written <FONT SIZE=2>(Mishlei 28)  </FONT><I>"A man oppressed by bloodguilt will flee to a pit; let none give him support".  </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Rambam, Laws of Murder and Protection of Life 4:9)</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the intent of the Gemorrah. If one repents completely from a sin of idolatry, his intentionally committed sins are judged as if they were unintentional, or possibly may even be considered as merits. But repentance is of no avail without undergoing punishment until his soul is cleansed.  The meaning of  "will never have a remedy" means that he will not escape judgement.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(<FONT SIZE=2>Rav Zvi Hirsch Hayyot, Sanhedrin 7a)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Rav Zvi Hirsch Hayyot, Aharon's intention was not only to avert calamity; it was to replace  a severe transgression which involves an extremely painful repentance &ndash; murder &ndash; with a different transgression, also severe, but less so &ndash; idolatry &ndash; which involves a more attainable repentance. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear, then, that Aharon cooperated with the Children of Israel in the Sin of the Calf, for their benefit and welfare. But can one participate in so serious a sin as the Golden Calm without injury, even if intentions were good? Therefore it is written "<I>And God was furious with Aharon", </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Devarim 9</FONT>).  Regarding this, Rabbi Nechemia said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzhak; Not everyone who is near, is near; and not everyone who is distant is distant. There may be one who is chosen, is rejected, and then again accepted; some may be chose and rejected, and not brought back.  Aharon was chosen:  -- <I>"and I chose them from among all the tribes of Israel to be My priests" </I><FONT SIZE=2>(I Samuel 2:28)  -- </FONT>was rejected  -- <I>"And God was angry at Aharon" -- </P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and it is written,<I> "And bring unto you Aharon your brother." </I>[Aharon's appointment to the High Priesthood, after the sin of the calf]. <FONT SIZE=2>(Bemidbar Rabba (Vilana) Parasha 3:2 "Who comes close").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see that Aharon acted out of acceptable motives, and therefore he was awarded the position of the High Priest. It now remains for us to consider whether Aharon's behavior can serve as a paradigm for all generations. The question is related to the controversy between Rashi and the Tosafot on the Gemorrah cited at the beginning of this article.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of Rabbi Tanchum bar Hanilai's dictum, it is written: "This passage reto the making of the calf."  Rashi understands that the passage referred to is: "<I>The grasping man reviles and scorns the Lord<FONT SIZE=2>" </I>(Psalms 10:3</FONT>); according to this understanding ,  Aharon made an unacceptable  compromise by making the calf. [Trans. note: The Hebrew b'z'a', usually translated as 'profit' (with a negative connotation), is translated in the Talmud as 'compromise'].</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tosafot, on the other hand, understands that Rabbi Tanchum is referring to a different passage: <I>"Proper rulings were in his mouth, and nothing perverse was on his lips; He served Me with complete loyalty and held the many back from iniquity." </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Malachi 2:6).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;According to this understanding, by cooperating with the sinning people, by making the calf as the lesser of two evils, "<I>In peace and straightforwardness he walked with me"  -- </I>Aharon acted in an exemplary manner, without blemish. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two ways of coping with religious revolt; Hur's way and Aharon's way. Two ways of serving God, both legitimate. Two paths, each deserving of respect and praise. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Hillel commanded us: "Be of Aharon's disciples, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving people and bringing them closer to Torah<FONT SIZE=1>." (Tractate of Avot I, 12)</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">"<B>A RED COW, WHOLLY-SOUND"</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Talmud </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>(Bavli, Kiddushim 31a) </FONT>relates an interesting story about an idolater who was exceptionally observant of the mitzva of honoring parents:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: Rabbi Eliezer was asked &ndash; To what degree must one honor father and mother? He replied: Observe what an idolater did for his father in Ashkelon &ndash; Dama ben Netina was his name. The Sages wished to purchase from him precious stones for the <I>ephod</I> for 60, 000 [dinar] &ndash; and Rab Kahanah taught 80,000 &ndash; and the key lay beneath his father's head, but he did not disturb him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A year later, the Holy One granted him his reward; a red heifer was born in his herd. The Sages of Israel came to him [to purchase the heifer] &ndash; he said to them: I know that even if I were to ask all the money in the world, you would pay it. But all I ask of you is that amount which I lost out of respect of my father. And Rabbi Hanina said: If one who is not obliged to observe the mitzvah [receives such a reward], all the more so one who is obligated! For Rabbi Hanina said: One who is commanded [to observe a <I>mitzva</I>] and fulfills his obligation is greater than one who is not commanded, yet observes the <I>mitzvah.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The red heifer was born to the herd of the idolater who was prepared to forgo much wealth rather than wake his father. His dedication to the <I>mitzvah</I> of honoring parents became the ideal for all of us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Our Sages considered the <I>ephod, </I>the <I>hoshen</I>, and the red heifer to be symbols of atonement. The <I>ephod</I> atones for idolatry, the <I>hoshen</I> (for which the Sages sought stones) atones for unjust rulings, and the red heifer atones for the sin of the golden calf ("Let the mother come and clean up the offal of her child") Midrashic tradition discerns a connection between the calf and the heifer which comes to atone for it.  A lot can be written about this story. It is possible that the this story demonstrates, among other things, the connection between the ability of parents (or adult leaders) to accept responsibility of their children's actions and the willingness of children to respect their parents. This is in keeping with the overall theme of the unit in the Gemarah, - Mizvoth of parents regarding children and mitzvoth of children regarding parents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</I></FONT>It may be possible, however, to discern another allusion to the concept of indirect responsibility in the difference between <I>"a red cow wholly/sound . . .  that has not yet yielded to a yoke"  </I>and "<I>the neck-broken calf  in the wadi . . . which has never pulled a yoke." (Egla Arufa)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Both the cow (the mother) and the neck-broken calf are part of atonement rituals.  They represent the acceptance of responsibility by accountable and mature leadership for acts performed by their public.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
</I></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, as is well known, the red cow effects purification for defilement caused by contact with a corpse. It is this defilement which prevents us from entering the Temple Mount. (We are well-acquainted with the controversy between our generation's <I>poskim</I> regarding the boundaries of the prohibition, a controversy which is not totally untainted by their personal attitudes towards issues of Torah, State, and the process of Geulah). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</I></FONT>Political processes have made our tie to the Temple Mount subject to public debate. Some rabbis from the religious Zionist camp feel the need to renew a Halakhic ruling regarding the obligation to ascend to certain areas of the Temple Mount in order to underscore our connection to the site of the Temple. The latest issue of "Hodesh BeHiddusho" (a monthly publication edited by some rabbis who are members of Meimad), featured an enlightening discussion about the relationship of <B>sovereignty to sanctity. </B>Gershon Gorenberg, a Jerusalem newspaperman, recently published a book dealing with the apocalyptic significance which Christians, Moslem and Jews assign to the Temple Mount (<U>The End of Days</U>, The Free Press.)  The debate, in all its aspects,  is undoubtedly very important.  Yet the absence of a physical red  heifer and the symbolic observance of the mitzvah  by the reading of "Parashat Para"  -- in the category of "Study and receive the reward" &ndash; should teach us that also the "death defilement" which prevents our ascension to the Mount, is not just a <B>technical</B> Halakhic obstacle.  Perhaps the religious and spiritual leadership should display maturity and responsibility by educating the public to a viewpoint which sees in the Temple and the Temple Mount true opportunities of contemplation and study of <B>holiness</B> within <B>life -  </B><I>"Let them build me a sanctuary and I will dwell <B>among them</B> &ndash; </I>not "in it", but "<B><I>among them". </B></I>They must not be drawn into precipitous and hasty acts which are intended to 'hasten the end'. Holiness is bound up with restraint and self-control &ndash; even at the revelation at Mount Sinai we were forewarned <B>"<I>Be on your watch against going up the mountain or against touching its border!"</P>
