<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Among the
instructions defining the behavior and activities of the priests, we find that
a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>cohen</i></span></span><i> </i>with a
defect may not participate in the holy ritual:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:45.0pt;text-align:justify'>And the Lord
spoke to Moshe, saying, &quot;Speak to <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span>,
saying, 'No man of your seed to their generations in whom there is a defect
shall come forward to offer his God's bread. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Vayikra</span> 21:17)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Most
traditional commentators explain these words in a relatively perfunctory
manner. This restriction is disturbing, however, for a liberal society striving
to relate to all its members equally, even though they differ physically from
each other. Why should these priests, who perhaps yearn to serve in the holy
ritual <i>as per</i> their hereditary legacy, suffer discrimination because of
a defect which does not impair their ability to perform the service with less
skill than their brother priests? (In this article we do not deal with the
gender-based discrimination which characterizes the performance of the priests
and our attitude towards them until this very day).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Thinkers and
exegetes who have dealt with this issue attribute the exclusion of the defect
carrier to the representational function of the <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE><i>cohen</i></span></span> in the sanctuary. <span class=SpellE>Rashi</span>,
in this context, refers us to the prophecy of Malachi, who compares the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City> service to the
grandeur of a pasha's court &quot;'For every man who has a defect shall not
come close' - it is proper that he not come close, as in &quot;When you present
a blind animal for sacrifice - it doesn't matter! When you present a lame or
sick one - it doesn't matter! Just offer it to your pasha: Will he accept you?
Will he show you favor? - said the Lord of Hosts'&quot; <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(Malachi 1:8)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The
explanation given by <span class=SpellE>RaSHaR</span> Hirsh, which was perhaps
influenced by the winds of Romanticism which blew in Germany in his time, also
calls attention to what the <span class=SpellE><i>cohen</i></span> represents as
he performs the holy ritual: &quot;The physical wholeness demanded [both of the
priest and of the offered animal] ... expresses also the wholeness of our
devotion - and also the wholeness of the life which we merit in the proximity
of the Lord. The altar of the Lord was not erected for the sake of the broken
and shattered, the blind and lame, the cripple, the paining and the sick; not
for this was the altar built, that the tired person should drag himself up its
stairs and there find comfort for his mourning or miraculous cures for his infirmity.
It is that life in all its wholeness, its freshness and valor, should there be
sanctified to a life of God-serving activity; and thus will they merit God's
blessings of youthful vigor and the life force. Life and courage, not death and
weakness dwell at the altar of the Lord; He demands the devotion of the whole
man, man in his wholeness shall there rise up and blossom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In our time,
Rabbi Yuval <span class=SpellE>Cherlow</span>, in a response presented on the &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Moreshet</span>&quot; site, also takes a similar position: &quot;Under
discussion is incompleteness, and it is His desire that the sanctuary service
be performed in wholeness, even in physical wholeness. Their defect is not an
indication of guilt. On the contrary, one may be the saint of the generation ...
a priest with a defect cannot be considered one who is whole, expressing even
in his external wholeness the service in the sanctuary.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>I happened to
read these passages when my family was watching an old film about an American
musical in the style of the 20's and 30's of the previous century - featuring
chorus lines of extravagantly attired male and female dancers executing
complex, closely-synchronized movements. In order to gain acceptance into the
musical, the female dancers had to exhibit not only their talents in song and dance,
but also their thighs. A leg deviating from the 'norm' would flaw the unified
appearance of the chorus line and detract from the play's perfection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>True, the priest
serving with splendor and proficiency in the temple is not comparable to a
dancer in a musical, but, I thought, this is exactly what was demanded of the
priest, to have a &quot;whole&quot; appearance, standard and not irregular, so
as not to blemish the grandeur and solemnity of the ceremonies which were
probably carefully choreographed, to the accompaniment of the song and playing
of the Levites. Anything less, according to the theories presented above, would
not do honor to the event, both in terms of the desire to worship the Lord in an
impressive and elegant ceremony, and also in terms of the impression that the
presentation was to make upon the observers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It seems,
however, that this blemished priest did not lack purposeful occupation. According
to the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>midrash</i></span></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>halacha</span> </i>in the <span class=SpellE>Sifra</span> (<span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Vayikra</span></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>, <span class=SpellE>Tazria</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Negaim</span>, Chap.1)</span>. Even the priest with a defect was
eligible for sitting in judgment in matters of contagion and quarrel: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>And he shall
be brought to <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> the priest&quot; - From this we
might infer only <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> himself; from where do we <span
class=GramE>learn</span> other priests [are also eligible]? The text says: &quot;the
priest&quot;. From where do we earn that even a blemished priest? The text
reads &quot;of his sons&quot; ... An alternative exposition: What does
Scripture teach us in &quot;Or to one of his sons the priests&quot;? Because it
says &quot;By their mouth shall be [determination] of every dispute and every
defect&quot; - the Torah juxtaposed disputes and defects - [to teach us that]
just as defects [may be decided] by a priest with a blemish, so disputes [may
be decided] by a priest with a blemish; just as disputes may not [be
adjudicated by] a relative, so defects not by a relative. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>We may also
surmise that particularly those priests not engaged in the ritual service were
more easily available for this occupation, one which demanded special
sensitivity. Expounding the passage (<span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>Vayikra</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> 13:3)</span>: &quot;And
the priest shall see the affliction on the skin of the body, and if the hair in
the affliction has turned white and the affliction seems deeper than the skin
of his body, it is skin blanch; when the priest sees it, he shall declare him
unclean&quot;, the <span class=SpellE>Sifra</span> infers from the words &quot;when
the priest sees&quot; - which seem redundant - that the priest must examine not
only the location of the affliction, but also the whole person who stands
before him. So explains R. <span class=SpellE>Ovadia</span> of <span
class=SpellE>Seforno</span>: &quot;And they shall instruct the afflicted to
inspect his behavior, and pray for himself, and the <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE><i>cohen</i></span></span> shall also pray for him, and because they
determine the nature of every affliction they acquire a sharp eye for stages of
appearances in order to distinguish between types of affliction&quot;. Who,
better than one who suffers an affliction himself can develop the sensitivity
required for viewing the afflicted person as a whole person, not reaching
conclusions from only the clearly visible affliction but also providing
spiritual counsel?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The discussion
of the priests' wholeness extends beyond the service in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City>. In the <span class=SpellE>Mishna</span>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Megilla</span> 4:7) </span>we
learn: &quot;A priest who has sores on his hands shall not raise his palms [to
bless the congregation]... because the congregation is looking at him&quot;. Here
the fear is not of a flaw in the grandeur of the event, but, on the contrary - we
are apprehensive that the attention of the supplicants will be shifted from the
benediction to the priest's irregular appearance. Despite this, the Talmud records
cases of priests with various blemishes who did raise their palms in the
synagogue. The Talmud reconciles: &quot;This refers to a case where the priest
is well-known in his community.&quot; Inasmuch as inhabitants of his town were
familiar with him, the irregularity of his appearance did not interfere with
their attention. This reservation was incorporated into the <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE><i>halacha</i></span></span><i> </i>(and in addition, accepted
tradition became the covering of the priests' heads and hands with prayer
shawls to prevent their being seen by the congregation). From an article that
Rabbi Benny Lau penned on the subject, we learn from the Talmudic discussion
that it is society which determines the attitude towards 'different' people; it
has the power to exclude them or to include them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>What can be learned
from the above regarding the attitude towards those with physical irregularities
in our time? Today there is a commendable tendency to include persons whose bodies
are irregular in all social frameworks. Despite this, on public stages, in the
world of entertainment and the media, there is still worship of physical
perfection and of those possessing the young and &quot;whole&quot; appearance.
These tendencies can arouse in those who feel that their appearance is &quot;flawed&quot;
a yearning to be like &quot;all the others&quot; and pressures (internal and
environmental) to fashion the body (or the soul) in order to acquire the &quot;accepted&quot;
appearance. The <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>halacha</i></span></span>
dealing with the temple service of the blemished <span class=SpellE><i>cohen</i></span>
determines a boundary for such attempts in certain matters; one whose appearance
is unsuitable will not be accepted. But this is so only for a narrow and
external compartment of public life. There are, however, positions in life and
community, in which coping with such irregularities will perhaps make one
highly suitable - especially in terms of development of the necessary insight,
sensitivity and idealism. On the other hand, it is incumbent upon us all to develop
a society in which attention is not drawn to the &quot;irregularity&quot; of
the person with different appearance. We must accustom ourselves to seeing the
whole person who stands before us, even when we know that perfection - in
ourselves and in others--exists only in outward appearance.</p>

these prohibitions were taught especially to the priests... ancient and modern
idolatry customarily associate religion with death. Only with the death of man
does the kingdom of the god flourish; dying and death are the main revelation
of the divinity; the lord is for them the god of death and not the god of life;
he takes life but does not give life; he sends death and its messengers -
sickness and poverty - so that man fear him, that he remember the power of the
god and the helplessness of the man. Therefore their temples stand alongside
graves, and the first place of their priest is near the corpse; in that place
where the eye is dimmed and heart broken, they find the proper soil to sow
religion. He who carries on his flesh the sign of death, the symbol of the
power of death which overcomes all - thus keeping us constantly aware of death
- is performing clearly a religious act...&nbsp;<b>not like these are the
priests of Israel.&nbsp;</b>Not so is the Torah of the God of Israel. Not so is
the religion of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Lord, who teaches the priest his status is <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>, is the&nbsp;<b>God of Life;&nbsp;</b>his
most exalted revelation is not through the power of death, which ruptures
courage and life; He reveals himself in the power of life which liberates and
vitalizes, which lifts man to desire freedom and to live the life of eternity.
He does not teach man how to die, but how to live; He teaches him how to
conquer death while still alive, how he will overcome the lack of freedom, the
physical subjugation and the sensual weakness; how he will live every moment of
moral freedom, a life of thought and will, creativity and action and also of
pleasure; this is the Torah, and God sanctified His Temple for its dwelling
therefore is it said especially to the priests: &quot;<i>They shall not shave
smooth any part of their heads...&nbsp;</i>let them not carry with them the
symbol of death;&nbsp;<b>in their appearance let them preach the power of life,
