<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>On another occasion they were
coming up to <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City> together, and just as
they came to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Scopus</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> they saw a jackal
emerging from the Holy of Holies. They fell a-weeping and R. <span
class=SpellE>Akiva</span> seemed merry. Wherefore, said they to him, are you
merry? Said he: Wherefore are you weeping? Said they to him: A place of which
it was once said, And the common man that <span class=SpellE>draweth</span>
nigh shall be put to death, is now become the haunt of jackals, and should we
not weep? Said he to them: Therefore am I merry; for it <span class=GramE>is</span>
written: And I will take to Me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest
and <span class=SpellE>Zecharia</span> the Son of <span class=SpellE>Berechiah</span>.
Now what connection has this Uriah the priest to Zechariah? Uriah lived during
the times of the first <st1:City w:st="on">Temple</st1:City>, while Zechariah
lived [and prophesied] during the second <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Temple</st1:City></st1:place>;
but Holy-Writ likened the prophecy of Zechariah to the prophecy of Uriah. In
the [earlier] prophecy of Uriah it is written, <span class=GramE>Therefore</span>
shall <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Zion</st1:City></st1:place> for
your sake be ploughed as a field, etc. In Zechariah it is written, <span
class=GramE>Thus</span> <span class=SpellE>saith</span> the Lord of Hosts,
There shall yet old men and old women in the squares of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City></st1:place>. So long as Uriah's [threatening]
prophecy had not its fulfillment, I had misgivings lest Zachariah's prophecy
not be fulfilled; now that Uriah's prophecy has been [literally] fulfilled, it
is quite certain that Zechariah's prophecy also is to find its fulfillment.
Said they to him: <span class=SpellE>Akiva</span>, you have comforted us! <span

suspected that he laughed because he believed that Ben <span class=SpellE>Koziva</span>
was the Messiah, and the Children of Israel will be saved by him. Said he to
them etc. and I rejoiced because as the words of Uriah were fulfilled, so will
ultimately the words of Zechariah etc, and even if the words of <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The three
opening chapters of the Book of <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> present the
narrative of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>'s desert
journey as described by Moshe on the steppes of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Moab</st1:country-region></st1:place>. There are discernable discrepancies
between Moshe's version and that appearing in the Books of <span class=SpellE>Vayikra</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Bemidbar</span>. For example, <span class=SpellE>Yithro's</span>
role in initiating the system of 'of the thousands and of the hundreds' is
absent and so is the Divine command to send spies. Many explanations offered by
the commentators to these changes attribute them to Moshe's attempt to
refashion the narrative for the children of the desert generation, those who
are soon to cross over to <span class=SpellE>Eretz</span> <span class=SpellE>Yisrael</span>
(so, for example the commentary of <span class=SpellE>Ramban</span> to the Book
of <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>, or <span class=SpellE>Abarbanel's</span>
introduction to <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>My intention
is not to deal with the details of these explanations, but to suggest a general
overview of Moshe's story of the desert journey. I wish to argue that two layers
of meaning may be identified in Moshe's version. In order to clarify the two
levels, I shall employ the <span class=SpellE>midrashic</span> method of
parable, the parables being two stories written and popularized in the past
decade which allegorically present the two layers in Moshe's story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The first level<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The first
story/parable tells of a father and his son walking on a path in a desolate
world, dark and cold. The father hovers over his son, protecting him from evil
people, feeding him, nourishing him in his illness. Even though the son angers
his father with his stubbornness, with his despairing of the long distance, the
father persists and carries him along. The son follows the father, holds on to
him, loves and admires him. He knows nothing of the world that was before, he
knows only one reality: a cruel world in which nothing other than his father
can be trusted. This is the essence of &quot;The Road&quot; by the American
author Cormack McCarthy. It is really the story of the Children of Israel's
journey, following the Father in Heaven: &quot;…And in the wilderness that you
have seen, where the Lord carried you as a man caries his son all the way that
you went as far as this place&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Devarim</span> 1:31) </span>Moshe tells the Children of Israel the
story of the journey in which God carries the Israelite nation on his
shoulders, feeding it the manna, and fulfilling its needs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>But in
contrast to the child who is tied to his father with all his soul, who follows
the noble and resilient man who tends to him, the Children of Israel who went
out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>
do not develop a similar attitude towards the Holy One. Yet worse, they do not
trust him, and have no faith in his promises regarding the Land: &quot;And
despite this thing you do not trust the Lord your God, Who goes before you on
the way to search out for you a place for our... And the Lord heard the sound
of your words, and He was furious...&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid
32-33). </span>Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The people
coming out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>
did not see in God a father image. The commitment, the admiration and
dependence of a child upon his father characterizes the attitude of the
Children of Israel to Moshe. This is the reason for their fear of entering the
Land, which led to the sin of the spies. Thus suggests the &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Meshekh</span> <span class=SpellE>Hokhma</span>&quot; on <span
class=SpellE>Parashat</span> &quot;<span class=SpellE>Shlakh</span> <span
class=SpellE>Lekha</span>&quot;, on the basis of the preacher in Sanhedrin 17b.
He claims that the Children of Israel heard from <span class=SpellE>Eldad</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Medad</span> that Moshe will die and not lead them into
the Land, and therefore they doubted their ability to conquer and expressed
lack of trust in the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>In the
beginning of the Book of <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>, Moshe tries to tell
the story differently. True, he tells about the generation of the wilderness
and does not hide their sins, but he quickly moves to emphasize the Holy One's
support of the Children of Israel in their recent battles. Moshe makes clear that
he will die and not enter the Land, but God's protection of the people will
continue. Thus Moshe tries to describe the difficult journey as did McCarthy, a
journey in which there is no mercy, but there is a father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>The second level<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The second
layer describes a mother protecting her son from afar. The son is a soldier who
goes out on a military operation, and the mother goes on a journey and tells
the story of herself and her son, in the hope that her words will protect him.
The son was born to a father who had suffered Arab imprisonment, remaining severely
wounded in soul and body. The father's fate is sealed, and he is socially marginalized.
The mother tries to raise the son alone, far from the father, to create for him
a different reality, but the child grows up, joins the army, and she senses and
knows the worst is embedded in her son's personality, and that he is in great
danger. The mother does not protect her son physically; the story that she
tells to herself, to the father of the son, and to the earth on which she
walks, this is intended to guard over him. This is the great drama in the novel
&quot;To the End of the Land&quot;*, written by <st1:PersonName w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName>
Grossman, a story which teeters between hope and despair and ends with the
author's terrible tragedy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The mother in
Grossman's story is compared to Moshe <span class=SpellE>Rabeinu</span>, the
father and son - two generations in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>. Therefore, the story which Moshe
writes is not directed only to the people, but also to the Supreme Power - the
Holy One, Blessed Be He, the only one capable of preventing the destruction of
the generation of the children who grew up in the laps of those who departed <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Moshe
fears that the trust-lacking genetic makeup <span class=GramE>of <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>'the</span> complainers of evil' may come to
light in the generation or the sons, and that history will repeat itself. Moshe
fears that the nation will sin, and that the Almighty will punish it as He did
the generation of the wilderness. Therefore, in a hidden underlying layer,
Moshe turns to God and tells the story somewhat differently from the actual occurrence.
He hopes thereby to protect the people he will soon depart, and uses the
revised history to appease the Lord and change fate. Reading the story on this
level also explains Moshe's references to the destruction of Temple &quot;Oh,
how can I carry by myself your trouble and your burden and your disputing?&quot;
and the Sages' decision to arrange the yearly calendar so that this <span
class=SpellE>parasha</span> in particular will always be read before the Fast
of the 9<sup>th</sup> of Av.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The two
stories/parables share a common basic line; both describe a journey of parents which
is intended to protect the children. The stories were written during the same
period in different places which were subject to murderous terror attacks. A somber
atmosphere hovers over both stories, but whereas at the end of the American story
hope awaits, the Israeli story leaves the reader with the painful sensation of
uncertainty. Can the parent protect the child, or is it too late?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Many parents
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
believe that the Jewish State will always have to live by the sword. Therefore
they are prepared to accept the fact that their children will have to live a
reality of war and uncertainty just as they did, and they do not do enough to
change the future. Are we indeed destined to always live on the threshold of
destruction? Must we accept the evil sentence? Is this not the time to
differentiate between our generation and that of our children?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>…It was essential that the State
devise a plan to forestall the calamity. But the inhabitants of the country
were divided into two factions, those who covered their heads, and those who
did not, and whatever one faction sought , the other blocked, and the factions
themselves were contentious among themselves, each hating each other, perhaps
even more than the common enemy hated both the covered heads and the bare
heads. How did it come about that one nation should become as two nations who
so hated each other? The explanation lies in events in the nation's history
which continue to influence, even though the world realities had changed and
the character of the people had changed, and its sons had abandoned all that
was dear to their parents. There existed a tradition in that nation that its
founding fathers were Jews, and since it was the practice of Jews to cover
their heads, therefore some were wont to cover their heads. And others, why did
they bare their heads? Because they consider themselves as Jews prior to receiving
the Torah, when they was no command to cover the head, and therefore they bared
their heads. And because these covered their heads and those bared their heads
they were divided and they hated each other. And why did those who covered
their heads hate each other, if all covered their heads? The answer is that
these wore <i>yarmulkes </i>[skullcaps], and those wore turbans... the latter were
larger out of jealousy, and the former were smaller than a louse... there was actually
no need for a head at all as long as the covering was conspicuous. And why did
the bare-headed hate each other, if all uncovered their hair? The answer is
that these grew forelocks and those cut their hair short; these were partially
bald and those were completely bald. Actually there was really no need for a
head at all, as long as it was bare... In one respect alone were they alike; each
group contended that all ills which befell the country were the fault of the opposing
side. And if the author of the Book of the State were not fearful of
redundancies, he might have said: &quot;Both these and those are words of truth&quot;.<span
