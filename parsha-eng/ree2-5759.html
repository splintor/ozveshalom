<H2>"And you shall be only joyful" <FONT SIZE="-1">(Deut.16:15) </FONT>:<BR>
The Danger of Thumb-twiddling.</H2>
<H3>by Shira Leibowitz  Schmidt</H3>

<P ALIGN="justify">	In describing the fall harvest holiday of Sukkot (Deut.16:14-15) the Torah uses the word for joy (<I>simha</I>) twice:"You shall be joyful in your holiday.....and you shall be <B>only</B> joyful." (The popular holiday song merges these phrases, from two different verses, into one lyric: "v'samahta b'hagekha, v'hayita <B>akh</B> smeah"). Not only is the superfluity puzzling, but the meaning of being "<B>only</B> joyful" is obscure.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	Abraham Ibn Ezra posits that the word "only"  (<I>akh</I>) comes to exclude sadness. The problem with this interpretation is discussed by Nehama Leibowitz a"h in her <I>Studies in the Book of Devarim.</I> "Is it not natural for man to rejoice when he sees the fruit of his toil, his harvest and vintage and granary overflowig?"  There should be no necessity for the Torah then to command us  (twice?!) to rejoice, and to do nothing but rejoice.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	I had the privilege of hearing Nehama teach a class on this verse, and she suggested one resolution of this difficulty, this <I>kushiya</I>, could be found in  the commentary, <I>Malekht Makhshevet</I>,  by the 16th century Italian scholar, Rav Moshe Hefetz. He connected the  phrase "you shall be only joyful" to the words immediately preceding it, "You shall hold the festival seven days...for the L-rd will bless all your crops and <B>all the work of your hands</B>, and you shall be only joyful."  Rav Hefetz writes, "Idleness is a source of evil-doing and sin. Abundance is one of  the causes of idleness...How then could the Almighty command us to rejoice by means of a cessation from work?..But the rejoicing ordained by the Torah is one which is not overdone, leading to levity and riotousness... For this reason, certain works were permitted on the intermediate days of the festival, in order to preclude idleness which leads to sin... 'For the L-rd will bless all your crops and all the <B>work of your hands</B> and you shall be only joyful' implies that you should indeed work and not sit idle, and then you will have real joy inspired by right purpose."
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	When Nehama taught this passage in class, she added an example not found in her book. She referred to the literary work of the 1924 Polish Nobel prize writer, Ladislav Reymont. In his novel <I>Summer</I> he describes the harvest rejoicing of the Polish peasants, the bounty that leads often to drunken revelry. This elicited from the European-born  participants in the class memories of  riotous rejoicing by the non-Jewish  folk in the countryside of eastern Europe; post-harvest festivities often spelled danger for Jews in shtetls.  Many years later I searched out the relevant passages in the book Nehama had mentioned off-handedly. "All the countryside was redolent of the fresh ripe grain... and all day long the lasses and lads made a joyful noise... When they came home in the evening, the harvesters of Lipka thrilled to the merry din of talk and laughter, of music and songs"  and trouble ensued.  A similar description is found in <I>The Slave</I> by  I.B. Singer who describes wild merrymaking at cropping time. "The peasants celebrated...danced and drank...and forgot their troubles. The children sipped vodka, laughed and giggled..."  This is the sequence of events that the  Biblical verse may be warning against: from autumn harvest bounty to idleness to wanton dancing and drinking  to trouble.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify"> 	A contemporary of Rav Hefetz described this in art. In "The Peasant Dance" the Dutch painter Bruegel depicts the sinning which can follow the religious fall harvest festival, the Kermes. This phenomenon is also depicted in music. Vivaldi, an  Italian non-Jewish landsman of Hefetz, wrote in  the score of  the autumn movemnt of the Four Seasons concerto,  that the peasant  harvest dance tune is  followed by "the drunken one falling asleep...while the dancers continue."
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	With this background we can understand the apprehension of  R.Hefetz, that seven Sukkot post-harvest days without the "work of your hands" must be tempered by warning us to moderate, limit our joy: <B>only </B>joy, not hilariousness.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	Does this imply  that non-Jewish celebration leads to inebrity? No, and no again. It must be made <B>absolutely clear</B>  that Hefetz was addressing a general human trait, a potential fault that Jews and non-Jews alike share. Bounty, with its ensuing idleness and celebration can lead all of us astray.  We must have no truck with those who see in the Torah's words support for Jewish superiority. The opposite is true: because the Israelites were  just as prone as anyone else to behaving wildly,   the Torah commands us not to be idle and  to modulate our joy. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">  	That this is a problem of human nature, can be seen in two other examples.  In Mishna Ketuvot 5:5  Rabbi Eliezer posits that "Even if a husband brought  his wife a hundred servants, she should still   embroider or work with wool,  because idleness leads to<I> zima </I> (lasciviousness); Rashbag says idleness leads to  <I>shiamum</I> (mental unbalance)."   Is idleness then a problem for women only? Again we must emphasize the Mishna here is talking about a human fault that can cause men as well as women to stumble.
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">     	That men's twiddling thumbs are just as likely to get them in trouble is expressed in a  second example, based on the verse "Six days you shall work and do all your labor" (Exodus 20:9).The simple meaning here is that for six days we may work or not work, but on the seventh we must desist.  However,  Avot dRabi Nathan uses this verse as an opportunity to drive home a midrash about the  dangers of idleness. "What should  someone do who has no labor? If he has an empty lot, or an idle field,  he should go and work in it, since it says:Six days you shall work...."   
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">	Idleness can lead all of us, Jew and non-Jew,  men and women, astray. One of  our contemporary problems is the intense focus on pleasure-seeking, possibly a sign of our ignoring the dangers of  economic plenty and excess leisure. Rav Hefetz  interpretated "you shall be only joyful"  as commanding us to moderate our joy with an admixture of work (and study); the distance from idleness to idolatry is not great.
