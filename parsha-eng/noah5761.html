This is characteristic of divine supervision: The Holy One decrees signs, e.g., tephillin, Shabbat, millah, to constantly remind one  of the great truths <B>upon which the peace of humanity depends.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>For ageless generations":   "</B></I>Doubly lacking.  [Translator's note &ndash; The Hebrew <I>dorot</I>  - "generations" - is spelled here without the two vowel vavs] God's covenant will exist in all situations; it will also protect the generation which is marked by defects  observable both internally and externally. In those generations, man's heart will melt, and he may despair of ever witnessing  divine justice. But the sight of the rainbow in the cloud  will remind him that God decreed a covenant with Man and with the earth; this covenant will be in force at all times, in all generations, and divine providence will achieve its goal &ndash; even in a flawed generation."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">" . . . in a world ruled in miraculous ways (before the Deluge), a world whose existence is never assured, there is no place for <I>mitzvoth; </I>a program of recognition of God and His service are possible only in a world subject to natural law. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that we read about the giving of <I>mitzvoth</I> only after the Deluge; Adam's first children were not obligated with <I>mitzvoth</I>.  Herein lies the deep meaning of what are traditionally termed "The Noachide Mitzvoth," which were given only after the flood.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&hellip; It was in this renewed world  -- the world destined to be our world  and not in the earlier, miraculous world --  that saw the opening of the  gate to the conflict between the values <I>tikkun olam  </I>(perfection of the world) and Man, a struggle realized in the revolutionary personality of our father, Avraham, who appears and begins to function at the end of Parashat Noach. He is the person who takes upon himself the mission of perfecting the world as Kingdom of God, rather than taking the world for granted. </P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A candle in memory of my father-in-law and mentor</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rabbi Doctor Yisrael Weinstock, who passed away 20 years ago,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cheshvan 5741</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOAH WAS THE FIRST MAN OF THE SOIL</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tsvi Mazeh</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The moral corruption of the generation of the Deluge led to God's decision: "<I>I will blot out humankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth."</I> His intent is reflected in His words to Noach: <I>"And I will blot out all existing-things that I have made,  from the face of the earth.". </I>He carried out his intention: <I>"He blotted out all existing-things that were on the face of the soil."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thrice the idea is expressed:   Man, created from earth but possessing a soul of life and the image of God, cannot exist on the face of the earth once he loses his spirituality and his character is debased.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the deluge, the world is granted a new beginning, one holding greater promise. Noah,  the righteous, wholehearted man saved by God from the flood, is the first man to erect an altar. In other words, it was he who insitutionalized the sacrificial rite. The  pleasant odors issuing from the sacrifices led God to decide that "<I>I will never curse the soil again on humankind's account." </I>Mankind begins to develop anew from the descendants of Noah. "<I>These three were Noah's sons, and from these were scattered abroad all the earth-folks."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But this new and promising beginning is immediately followed by another fall, this time by the father of the new mankind: <I>"Now Noah was the first <B>man of the soil; </B>he planted a vineyard. When he drank from the wine, he became drunk and exposed himself in the middle of his tent."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The imbibing of wine leads Noah to drunkenness, which results in the loss of human dignity, in brutishness. This situation is exploited by his son, Ham, in order to witness his father's  nakedness, expressing further degradation. The results of this event are far-reaching. A third of humanity, all the descendents of Ham, are cursed &ndash; "<I> . . . servant of servant shall he be to his brothers!"  </I>He who would exploit the momentary weakness of another in order to harm him is sentenced to servitude, the apex of man's maleficent rule over man.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The verse describing the chain of events which eventually lead to Ham's being cursed calls Noah "<B><I>man of the soil". </B></I>We are immediately reminded of Noah's birth and of the hope of his father, Lemech:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>May this-one-comfort-our-sorrow from our toil, from the pains of our hands coming  from the soil, which God has damned." </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is conceivable that the verse which terms Noah "<B><I>man of the soil" </B></I>wishes to whisper something additional into our ear. Our Sages said in Midrash Rabba:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Three were eager for soil,  but their efforts were in vain:  Kayin, Noah, and Uzziyahu."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma">It is worthwhile to focus briefly on the three subjects of the Midrash.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma">Regarding Kayin, the verse reads: <I>"And Kayin became a worker of the soil."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A feasible exegesis  may be that Kayin's nature became that of a worker of the soil, perhaps even a slave of the soil. Soil represents man's material aspect, that component which leads to avarice, ownership,  coerciveness, materialism, hedonism. Man was placed in the Garden of Eden <I>"to work it and watch over it",</I>  over that very soil from which he was formed. But Man must be on guard, lest the soil rule over him, becoming the focus of his life. The danger is, as expressed by in midrash, that Man be <I>eager for the soil.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kayin, who became a worker of the soil, degenerated  to point of fratricide. According a midrash quoted in Midrash Rabba it was the lust for land which led the brothers to quarrel: "<B><I>And Kayain said to his brother Hevel"</B> <B>-- </I> What were they discussing? They said, Come, let us divide up the world. One took the land and the other took the movables.  This one said, The land upon which you sand is mine. And the other said, that which you are wearing, is mine. This one says, Fly away, and the other says, Undress</B>." In other words, the first murder in history is the tragic finale to a argument which, from Kayin's point of view, is  focused upon rule over land. </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>A sound &ndash; your brother's blood cries out to me <U>from the soil</U>! . . .  And now, damned be you <U>from the soil</U> . . . When you wish to work <U>the soil</U> it will not henceforth give its strength to you, wavering and wandering must you be on earth."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kayin's punishment is the negation of his essence as a worker of the soil. The earth no longer belongs to Kayin. He who became a slave to the earth must be exiled from his land.  His sentence is sealed &ndash; he must be a wavering wanderer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the expulsion from the Eden, God told man "<I>Damned be the soil on your account." </I>The earth, too, is cursed by God's fury. In the case of Kayin, the curse recedes somewhat from the earth. The curse is placed upon murderer, even though the curse is expressed through the earth. Only in God's positive words after the deluge, quoted at the beginning of our study, does God promise never to curse the soil again. In any case, even during the period when earth is accursed --  from the expulsion from Eden until Noah's sacrifices --  the earth is cursed <U>for Man; </U> earth itself is not accursed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third image mentioned in the midrash as craving for land is Uzziya, one of most successful kings from the lineage of King David. The Book of Chronicles tells of his military and political successes, including  the establishment of a professional army numbering over 300,000 warriors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>And his name spread to the boundary of Egypt" &ndash; </I>with the exception of Egypt, his kingdom was one of the mightiest in the ancient East.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tanakh relates his agricultural projects: "<I>And he hewed many wells, for he had many cattle in the loand on the plains, farmers and vintners in the mountains and on the Carmel, for he loved the soil."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to our midrash, the end of the previous verse  described Uzziya's exaggerated love of soil, a love which led to his bitter end: "<I>When he was strong, he grew so arrogant he acted corruptly;  he trespassed against his God by entering the Temple of the Lord to offer incense on the incense alter"  -- </I>which eventually  resulted in " . . <I>leprosy broke out on his forehead."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be that the placement of soil at the top of his order of  values was what brought about Uzziya's haughtiness.&#9; Haughtiness can disorient even man's spiritual component, that which leads him to offer sacrifices in the service of God. Pride  can bring Man to attempt forceful dominion even over the most spiritual  -- the offering of incense.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We return to Noah. It is possible that the beginning of his decline lay in his transformation from an "<I>Ish tsaddik" &ndash; </I>a righteous man &ndash; as described before the Flood, into an  "<I>Ish adama" </I> - a man of the soil &ndash; after the inundation. (Rabbi Berechiya, in Midrash Rabba, censures Noah's decline, especially through comparison with the spiritual development of Moshe, who began as an "<I>Ish Mitzri" &ndash;</I> an Egyptian man &ndash; but finished his life as an "<I>Ish Ha-Elokim" - </I> a man of God.)  When Noah's central being becomes the soil, and his earlier righteousness pales, restraints are loosed, and creeping intoxication finally brings on disgrace.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, according to the midrash,  a threefold thread binds Kayin, Noah, and Uzzia. All three are overwhelmed by passion for land &ndash; the means becomes an end. In the three instances, to quote the admirable phrasing of the midrash, " . . . but their efforts were in vain."    Is this not always the case? When the means becomes the goal, in the end the goal is not achieved and the means are also lost. </P>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma">The Jewish people, as a collective, must withstand the incessant temptation to become slaves &ndash; physically and mentally &ndash; to the soil. The Jewish religious ideal is service of God &ndash; "<I>For it is to me that the Children of Israel are servants." </I> "The servant of God alone is free," said Yehudah Halevi.  Processes taking place in part of the religious Zionist population remind us how strong  is  the temptation to place the earth, the earth of Eretz Yisrael in particular,  at the top of our order of priorities. Woe unto us if we transform the means into a goal. The Sabbath of the Land, the year of Shmittah which is now beginning, is supposed to remind us every seven years that the land belongs to God. Shmitta is the symbol of overcoming the lust for land which is so contagious. There is good reason for the <I>Tochacha's &ndash; </I>the admonition in Sefer Vayikra -  attributing  Israel's exile from its land to failure to observe the Shmittah &ndash; "<I>The land will have to be left behind by them, attaining acceptance through its Sabbaths . . . "  </I>When the people cannot disengage itself from working the land once in seven years, it is not worthy of dwelling in its land, and land is undeserving of the people. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Return to Zion in our day is the exodus of the Jewish people from an existence marked by detachment from the soil. We have returned to the earth to work it and to watch over it &ndash; not to become enslaved by it.</P><DIR>

</I></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "Days of Awe" at the beginning of this year received, to our sorrow, additional meaning, just as the Yom Kippur War added a new dimension to Yom Kippur. In the papers, stories and memoirs of that war appear alongside notices of memorial gatherings for soldiers who fell. In many synagogues the cantor adopted the "Beit Hashitta" melody for "<I>Unetaneh Tokef"; </I>that bloody war became part of the national Yom Kippur consciousness.  Rabbi Tsadok HaCohen explained the phrase "Days of Awe" as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Therefore are they call "Days of Awe", for they spread awe over men, and it is a time for repentance for all, as is written: "Now that (man) was created, he should search - <I>yefashpesh - </I>[his actions]. Others say he should feel &ndash; <I>ye'mashmesh. </I>  (Anthology of Articles)  </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> There is no doubt that the Yom Kippur War was, for many in the Israeli public, an important turning point, arousing many to take stock. This self-examination in the wake of many deaths of our people, gave birth to different thoughts and attitudes.  Even as the nationalistic-Messianic consciousness intensified, many understood that the power-induced high brought about by the Six Day War was but a dangerous illusion.  At the time of writing, we do not know when rationality and calm will return to our land. But it seems that Rabbi Zadok's apt definition is appropriate to the current "Days of Awe".  We are again entering a period of apprehension which obligates to us introspection and soul-searching regarding today's unnecessary bloodshed, abysmal hatred and the desecration  of the human image. As Yaakov prepared for his meeting with Esav, we read (Breishit 32;8)  "<I>Yaakov became exceedingly afraid and was distressed." </I> The Midrash explains, "<I>VaYirah" &ndash; </I>He was afraid &ndash; lest he kill;  "<I>Va-yetser lo" &ndash; </I>he was distressed &ndash;  lest he be killed."  Our father Yaakov's legacy obligates us to constantly seek possible courses of action neither to be killed nor to kill.  The midrash offers three explanations of the atmosphere which brought the deluge upon humanity in the days of Noach: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>The earth was filled with 'chamas'  - wrongdoing." </I>Said Rabbi Levi: <I>"Chamas"</I> &ndash; this is idolatry; <I>"Chamas" &ndash; </I>this is licentiousness; <I>"Chamas" </I>&ndash; this is bloodshed. <I>Chamas </I>is idolatry,  as is written "<I>For the world was filled with chamas;</I> <I>Chamas </I>is licentiousness, for it is written (Jeremiah 51) "<I>Let the violence done by  me and my kindred be upon Babylon." "Chamas </I>is bloodshed, as is written (Yoel 4) "<I>Because of the chamas to the people of Judah, In whose land they shed the blood of the innocent,"  - "chamas" </I> in its simplest meaning."&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=3>(Bereshit Rabba, Chap. 31)</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A society in which all limits have been breached loses its human image, and cannot continue to exist. We all hope and pray that this unnecessary bloodshed soon cease, </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"For we came into this world not for the sake of controversy and conflict, God forbid, nor for hatred and envy and argument and bloodshed, God forbid; we came into the world in order to recognize and know You, Who Is Forever Blessed. And may there come realization of the verse: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I will give peace throughout the land, so that you will lie down with none to make you tremble. I will cause-to-cease wild beasts from the land, and a sword shall not cross through your land."</I> (From Rabbi Nachman of Breslav's Prayer for Peace)</P></DIR>
