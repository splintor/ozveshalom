<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The above
question has seemingly engaged mankind forever. Many and varied answers have
been given, not only by non-Jewish sources but by Judaism itself. Before we
detail the different answers, some of which appear in this week's parasha, let
us consider what it is that so intrigues us about the beginning. Why do we so
long to know and recognize the starting point of our world?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It may well be
that the urge to know how the world was created flows from the human desire to
disperse the cloud of apprehension which derives from the very existence of
mystery. We assume, perhaps without sufficient basis, that knowing how the
world was created will facilitate a better understanding of its functioning
also in the present, thus lessening the danger of catastrophe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>But the
connection between creation and values of the present also works in the
opposite direction. Explanations of the Creation exploit the interest they
arouse to present the values of the present world as tied to the creation of
the world. The Genesis narratives have great educational value, and therefore
they are used and re-fashioned repeatedly in order to pass on to their learners
the ‘correct' world-view. Thus can be explained the phenomena of multiple
answers to the question of creation. In light of the above description it seems
that examination of the creation stories can teach us a lot about the outlooks
which those who supply the answers passed on to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
class=SpellE>Chazal</span> determined that &quot;Whoever looks at four things,
better that he had not come into this world&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> <span class=SpellE>Chagiga</span> 2:1). </span>One
of the four is &quot;What is inside?&quot; meaning what was there before the
creation of the world. <span class=SpellE>Chazal's</span> dictum reinforces the
feelings of fear and curiosity. It turns out that dealing with the question of
the world's origin is not only fascinating, as we sense intuitively, it is also
forbidden and perilous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>That same <span
class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> also seems to provide the rationale for the prohibition;
&quot;Whosoever does not show respect for his maker, it is proper that he not
come into the world&quot;. According to the Mishnah, engaging in the question of
creation is bound up with the risk of insulting the Holy One, blessed be He. Man,
in a kind of role reversal, is called upon to protect and take pity on his god.
But again the question arises: Why and how does engaging in the question of &quot;What
is within?&quot; affect God's honor?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Perhaps we
should expand the explanation and claim that comprehension of the creation also
contains man's pretensions of creating a world himself, imitating his Creator.
If this be his aspiration, we can understand why human knowledge can affect the
honor of the Holy One - for it affects His exceptionality as Creator of the
World. Therefore, concurrent with the <span class=SpellE>Mishnah</span> (which disapproves
of engaging in questions of creation}, or shortly thereafter, the Sefer <span
class=SpellE>HaYetsira</span> - The Book of Creation - was also written. The
Talmud says that this book enables man to create living creatures, thereby
reconstructing the process of creation. It seems that Chazal themselves, even
as they criticized inquiry into creation, they also indulged in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The subject of
the structure of the universe and investigation into its origins also take a
place of honor in modern astrophysics, expressing more than anything the human
yearning not only to supply intelligent answers to the questions which threaten
Man, but also to eliminate the mysteries - and with them, the divinity - from
the physical world around us, completing thereby the Nietzschean gambit of
replacing God with the human intellect. Science is not only the pure desire for
knowing, it also expresses powerful drives of human hubris, which, of course,
affects the honor of God and His presence in our world. This claim is not
dependant upon the wish and intention of this or that scientist, but is
inherent to the entire modern project that has secularized the world around us,
whether we so desire or not. As part of the tendency to secularization, modern
science seeks to explain all natural processes as self-propelled results of a
single basic situation, without the addition of divine intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>As we have
said, this question has many answers in our culture and elsewhere. The answers
teach us not only about the creation of the world, but above all about the
picture of the world and about the perception of Man with which the answerers
wanted to present us. In other words, we are talking about narratives with an
educational purpose, directed at implanting in their readers a specific weltanschauung.
Following is a survey only of those answers which appear in the parasha of this
week, emphasizing those insights which arise regarding the relation between the
world, Man, and God. Similar analyses could be made with regard to additional
answers, from both within our culture and from without, which I will mention
briefly at the end, including those of modern science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>The method I
will employ is based upon Rav M. <span class=SpellE>Breuer's</span> &quot;Aspect
Approach&quot;. According to this method, the first step in approaching a Biblical
text is the search for inner contradictions, differentiation between different approaches
revealed in the text, and the discovery of the inner logic in each of them. In
the second stage, we seek the meaning of the integration of the varying approaches
in the complex text. We shall make do with defining the various approaches in
their first stages, leaving for the readers the task of creating integration
between them. In the case before us, in which we deal with the Torah itself,
the contradictions do not represent different creators, but rather different
aspects and points of view attributed all to the giver of the Torah. </p>

beginning, God created heaven and earth&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>Commenting
on this verse, Rashi stressed the contradictions between it and the remainder
of the chapter. He attempted to resolve them, since his exegetical approach,
like other midrashic approaches, is directed at harmonization of the Biblical
text. According to the Aspect Approach, the integration of the different
approaches is not intended to arrive at a single narrative, but at a complex
message expressed through the dissimilarity between a <span class=GramE>number</span>
of narratives, each carrying its own simple message not necessarily compatible
with the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>Therefore,
we will try to study the creation story before us in this verse alone. The
verse encompasses the entire creation, and claims that the Holy One created the
world in a single act, as we know it. It is understood that in this depiction,
the Holy One is presented as possessor of the ultimate power. Man plays no
part; he is a marginal detail in the tremendous creation of heaven and earth.
We have no idea how the world was created, and the mystery surrounding the
questions remains in its totality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>This
narrative is known as the main description of the creation of the world, and,
without doubt, it presents very meaningful messages. The story is told from a
human point of view, and already at its beginning there is expression of the
fear of the dark and the depths - fear characteristic of human beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>According
to the passages before us, the Holy One does not create the world, but rather
classifies and organizes the <i>tohu <span class=SpellE>va'vohu</span></i> - the
welter and waste - and imposes order, discipline and security in a world that was
previously meaningless, and therefore, threatening. The Holy One functions as
an educator and savior who brings light to the world, arranges it, assigns a
name to everything, such as day, night, firmament, water, etc. This activity,
like human activity, takes place in time, and is spread over three days. Only
on the third day, after the major areas (sea, dry land, the heavens) have been
defined [in the eyes of yet-to-be-created man], does the Holy One begin to
create within these spaces the plants, the lights, the living creatures and
man. The term &quot;and He created&quot; appears only in the context of the
creation of the <i>tanninim</i> [the great sea-monsters] and the creation of Man,
but not in the context of creation of the heavens, the sea, and the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>God's
main work tools in this story are speech and language. We receive intimations
that understanding and knowledge of speech, shared by us and God, makes
possible dominion over the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>With
the conclusion of the process, God rests from his task as organizer of the
world, giving it over to Man. Man is the <st1:PersonName ProductID="new king"
w:st="on">new king</st1:PersonName> of the world, and his task is to continue
his work of learning the organization and ordering of the world, through the
means of his understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>This
story, like its predecessor, involves man in the creation of the world, but, in
contrast to the earlier story, there is conflict between Man and the world
around him. Man here is not called upon to rule over the world, but to work in
it. He appears as a lonely creature, in need of a mate and partner for
conversation, seeking one in this world into which he was thrust, and he
despairs of finding one. Ultimately, the world does not solve man's problem of loneliness,
and God, in His mercy, creates from Man's rib an everlasting edifice. In this
story, in contrast to the two preceding ones, Man remains dependent upon the
Holy One even after his creation. Here begins a religious model, one in which
man is commanded to forgo some of the offerings of the world around him. Not
only does the world around Adam not supply his needs; it reveals itself to be a
stumbling-block and a trial. Indeed, Adam and Eve are quickly tempted and fall
into the depths of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>The
world, according to this version, can be seen as an extra-human system and, from
a moral-religious aspect, a threatening challenge. In this story, the Holy One
remains present in Man's world, setting forth moral and religious obligations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;tab-stops:0cm'>These
three stories, representing different notions of the Holy One and the relations
between Him, Man, and the world, are but the beginning of a long line of
additional stories which I shall present here only as captions. Already in
Bereishit Rabba <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Parasha 1 and Parasha 3) </span>Chazal
present in their descriptions of the creation process the questions regarding
the relations between the Torah and the real world, between light and the Holy
One, between heaven and earth. The ancient Book of Creation presents a totally
different approach from that presented in the Torah; the world was created by
means of language. Throughout history we can find many additional narratives,
such as that of the Ari, according to which the main burden in the creation
process falls upon man, as repairer of the world, or that found in the
teachings of Rav Ashlag, who described the creation of the world as an act of
love.</p>

himself to spiritual activity, and not only to his daily bread, Man would not
fight Man, and the concept of possessions would not carry so much weight.
