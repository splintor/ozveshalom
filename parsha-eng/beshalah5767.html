and turn on their heels; they stand before the danger of drowning in the sea,
of hunger and thirst - and they are miraculously saved. The national mood
changes quickly from depression to elation and back to complaining and
continuing lack of faith in God. The slaves who have just been freed are deemed
incapable of facing the Philistines:<i> God did not lead them [by] way of the
land of the Philistines for it was near, because God said, &quot;Lest the
people reconsider when they see war and return to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region

week's <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> is multi-vocal. These voices appear
and reappear throughout the <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>. Of course, the <span
class=SpellE>parasha's</span> dominant voice is that of the masculine Song of
the Sea and the accompanying women's singing. This is a public song of
thanksgiving, a song of togetherness. It is the song of a choir in which order
and harmony are preserved. <i>Then sang Moses and the children of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region></i> - the
verb <i>sang</i> appears in the singular.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>However,
other strident voices are heard in the <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>. In
contrast to the Song of the Sea's unusual unity - the one-time voice of
response to the miracle of the splitting of the Red Sea - the <span
class=SpellE>parasha</span> presents the recurring voice that arises from the
throats of sons and daughters of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>. The usual, everyday voice
of the Israelites shouts and protests, it is a voice of complaint, rebellious
and demanding. <i>And the Children of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> cried out</i> - the crying
out is described in the plural in order to express the mix of protesting and
shouting voices. <i>And the people complained</i>, <i>and the entire community
of the Children of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
complained</i> - these also use the plural form of the verb. Things come to
such a pass that Moses himself cries out, whether we understood him as joining
in the people's outcry or as merely passing on the people's outcry to God's
ears. <i>And the Lord said to Moses: &quot;Why do you cry to me?<span
class=GramE>&quot;<span style='font-style:normal'>;</span></span></i> <i>And
the people complained to Moses, saying: &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; And he
cried to the Lord. And Moses cried to the Lord, saying, &quot;What shall I do
with this people? Soon they will stone me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>When
the Israelites were caught in a vise between Pharaoh's army and the sea, they
cried out of their grave crisis - and receive an order to be silent. <i>The
Lord will fight for you, and you shall be quiet.</i> But the people did not
fall silent. They sang the Song of the Sea. It was precisely out of the silence
which united them and ended their shouting that there arose the unusual event
of their singing in unison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>One
does not sing in daily life. Usually, the Israelites related to their leaders
by way of complaint, grumbling, and shouts. Moses points this out repeatedly
while rebuking the people in the book of <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>. In
contrast, the Torah presents God as one who speaks or talks. God always speaks,
and He commands Moses to speak instead of crying out. And the Lord spoke to
Moses: &quot;Why do you cry out to <span class=GramE>Me</span>? Speak to the
Israelites...&quot; Despite the cries of Moses and the Israelites, God answers
them and relates to their troubles. It is precisely against the background of
their cries that God's speech to them and concern for them becomes salient. There
is a flow and a connection between cries and speech, between grumbling and
response, between the harmonious song and the everyday cacophony of voices. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

EN-US'>The <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> deals with another line of tension;
the tension between water and earth and between sea and land.</span></span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'> The waters of the <st1:place w:st="on">Red
 Sea</st1:place> threaten to drown the Israelites, and the safety of dry land
is their refuge. The miracle of the splitting of the <st1:place w:st="on">Red
 Sea</st1:place> exposes the dry land and throws the water aside. The dry land
is exposed with the help of the staff, which is itself part of a tree that grew
on dry land. The tree overcomes water. This motif repeats itself in the story
that follows immediately upon the Song of the Sea. The bitter and undrinkable
waters of Mara threatened to kill off the Israelites with thirst. The tree - a
typical symbol of dry land - sweetens the water. The water did not sustain the
tree and sweeten its fruit. Quite the opposite: the tree sweetened the water. <i>And
the Lord showed him a tree and he threw it into the water and the water was
sweetened</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
staff served Moses once again in the <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> when he
used it to hit the rock in order to take water from it. The two earlier stories
- that of the splitting of the <st1:place w:st="on">Red Sea</st1:place> and
that of Mara - mention water, but there the water was evil and injurious. Here,
in contrast, we have a story about a lack of water. As in the earlier stories,
the solution takes the shape of a tree; the staff hits the stone and brings
forth water from it. The water did not bring the tree - rather, the tree brings
the water. The natural order of cause and effect is reversed. Such is the
nature of miracles and so the routine is broken. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The <span
class=SpellE>parasha</span> relates to yet a third tension; that between memory
and the present. We are commanded to remember miracles in general and the Exodus
from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in particular. The <span class=SpellE>parasha</span> deals with memory in two
different places; the commemoration of the manna and the commemoration of the
battle with <span class=SpellE>Amalek</span>. Moses instructs Aaron, <i>take a
jar and put a full <span class=SpellE>omer</span> of manna into it and place it
before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations</i>. Following the
battle with <span class=SpellE>Amalek</span>, God tells Moses: <i>Write this as
a remembrance in a book</i>. In both cases, God commands the
institutionalization of memory. This is done by using a text or a sample of manna.
That is to say, the memory is placed inside a jar or between two book-covers as
something closed and defined while a different reality takes hold around it. Memory
exists within a space of forgetting. There is tension between remembered
historical events and the present, just as there is tension between unusual,
miraculous events and everyday routine. A persistent miracle is no miracle at
all, but rather part of the ordinary. Memory which is not history is the
present, so of course it is not memory. No wall of iron divides between the
poles of miracle and nature, of cause and effect, of history and memory. This
is not a matter of dichotomous extremes, but rather of complementary aspects. Nature
gains its lawfulness from the miraculous no less than the miraculous gains its
authenticity from nature. The shouting and bickering of routine everyday life
are illuminated by the Song's temporal uniqueness. The Song, in turn, can only
stand out against the background of disharmonious noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

generation of the wilderness ate manna daily. They needed no jar to remind
them. Those who fought <span class=SpellE>Amalek</span> had no need for a book.
Only the later generations, for whom the manna and the battle against <span
class=SpellE>Amalek</span> were no longer matters of personal experience needed
to read the book and view the jar of manna. It was not the case that everyone
was always viewing the jar of manna or reading the book. They lived the present
in the present. A memory which is always activated is not a memory. There can
be no memory without forgetting, and the past cannot survive without a present
that is different from it. The other context and everyday life are the jar in
which the manna is preserved, just as they constitute the book's binding. On
the one hand, the binding sets limits to text and memory. On the other hand it
keeps memory alive and places it within the contemporary context.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'><span style='color:black'>2) Beyond the personal stories, the stories of
the patriarchs reflect a broad national-historical process, which is part of
the encompassing process of divine providence. Those stories must be
interpreted in light of that broader process. For example, Jacob wound up in <span
class=SpellE>Laban's</span> house in order to marry his daughters and create
the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Another example: the sale of Joseph paved the way
for the exile in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the redemption from it and from all of the other exiles in their wake. Jacob's

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

the absolute divine truth that guides the Torah - is limited by its very
nature, in accordance with the limits of human understanding. That is why
certain conditions apply to it and in certain cases the Sages permit one to
lie. These are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>1) For the sake of peace, such
as when God told Abraham that our mother Sarah did not laugh at his old age,
but rather at her own age when she was told of Isaac's future birth. One is
also permitted to say that an ugly article of clothing is attractive in order
to avoid insult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

life. For instance, one is permitted to lie to a terminally ill person if true

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

that Moses referred to the time of the plague of the first born as being <i>around
midnight</i> even though God had announced the time as being precisely <i>midnight</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

verse from Psalms </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'>(18:26)</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'> puts it: <i>With
a saintly one, <span class=GramE>You</span> show Yourself saintly, but with a
crooked one, You deal crookedly.</i> That is how Jacob dealt with the cheating <span
class=SpellE>Laban</span> - he took his family and ran away from him after <span
class=SpellE>Laban</span> had cheated him out of his wages and switched Rachel
with Leah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

paganism, idolatrous rites or a false ideology (<i>remove the false path from
me</i> - </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Psalms
119</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>), as the default option
when honest means fail. Abraham and Rachel destroyed their parent's idols at
the price of having to lie. In this way they paved the way to monotheism, which
is the foundation of the Jewish faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>This principle also applies to
Jacob taking the blessings instead of Esau; he did this in order to bequeath
them to the People Israel, in keeping with God's historical plan. If, God
forbid, Esau had received the blessings, the plan would have been disrupted,
causing a national and spiritual catastrophe to the Jewish People. Isaac, who
had grown up in a good environment was seduced by Esau's feigned observance of
the commandments. Rebecca and Jacob's less savory family background taught them
to see through Esau's pretense and to recognize his wickedness and the
spiritual danger he posed. They also realized that the blessings were meant for
Jacob. Perhaps, when Rebecca dressed up Jacob in Esau's clothing she was trying
to hint to Isaac that he should not judge a book by its cover, but rather by
its contents. Indeed, Isaac learned to accept that message. When Jacob's identity
was revealed by his good manners, by the fragrance of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Eden</st1:City></st1:place> that wafted from him, and especially by
his voice; his mentioning God's name - his faith in personal providence, then Isaac
consciously gave him the blessings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

blessings; he had clearly purchased the first-born status from Esau. Esau's
claims regarding Jacob's double deception in stealing both the first-born
status and the blessings were baseless. In addition, even Esau's angel
confirmed that Jacob received them fairly, and in order to clear his name of
any dishonest connotation, he changed it to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>. (By the way, Jacob's name
derives from the fact that he grasped Esau's ankle [<span class=SpellE><i>akev</i></span>]
