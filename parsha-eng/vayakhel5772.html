for the hooks and rings. Copper was to be used for the sockets of he outer planks

religious purposes as a place of worship. Nearly every religion and
civilization possessed some sort of sanctuary whose architectural style
complements the style of worship and the character of its adherents. Generally
speaking, the building represented the outstanding contemporary architectural
design. This was reflected in the splendor of the structure, its accompanying
artistry, and its location visa vie the city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>The <b>'mishkan,'</b> also called by a more
illustrious name, <b>'ohel moed', </b>was the most fascinating<b> </b>structure
of ritual worship of them all<b>. </b>When one examines the instruction for its
design and construction, the terms used repeatedly are: curtains, hooks,
planks, loops and bars. It is difficult to describe its design as
splendiferous. The people engaged in its construction were, as described by the
text as 'skillful'. Bezalel , the supervisor of the work, <b>was divinely
endowed with</b> <b>'skill, and excelled in ability</b>'. Indeed the objects
within the mishkan itself were superior, made with much gold, silver, copper
and rare wood. Nevertheless, the building itself, made to be collapsed and
portable, containing many objects designed in exact detail, could not be termed
'magnificent'. At best, it could be described as functional, temporary and
portable, serving the children of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> in their trek across the
desert. This was not the permanent sanctuary that was to be erected in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City> that would
reflect the most advanced architecture that would inspire in the simple man
beholding it, a sense of awe and excitement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>Indeed, relative to an encampment in the desert,
the mishkan was glorious, spacious and distinguished from other tents
structures. I am of the opinion, however, that the mishkan was more than a
functional, efficient holy structure for life in the desert.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>The Bet HaMikdash built later on in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>, was built on
land consecrated for this purpose. Laws of ritual purity applied to anyone
entering its area. The temple area would retain its sanctity forever. The sole
surviving supporting wall would of itself be elevated to a status of sanctity
and become a place for prayer and an important national symbol. This relation
to a holy site is both reasonable and recognized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>In contrast, however, the notion of a 'ohel moed'
is radical and presents a surprising alternative. <b>A collapsible holy
structure!</b> A temporary sanctuary, curtains bound one to another, completely
assembled- only to be disassembled and transported to another site. The ground
upon which it once stood however, was relegated to its original secular status.
The encampment encircled the mishkan. The presence of the Holy One in the form
of a cloud dictated the pace of the journeys, the entrance into the 'holy of
holies' was forbidden to all save the High Priest on the most holiest of days,
the others who serve in the sanctuary were especially selected and trained for
their roles.<span style='color:yellow'> </span><span style='color:black'>All
the rules that transformed the mishkan into a center where one can conjoin with
God, applied to this place. When the cloud rose they assembled the structure
together with all its implements and fabrics and proceeded onward- and the place
where the mishkan stood was once again exposed to the winds and sands of the
desert, blending into the open and natural landscape. When again they encamped
, the mishkan was re-erected, its implements positioned in their proper places,
the curtains, the covers, the covering of the Holy Ark and the 'parochet'-the
cloud once again covered the tent and <b>the Divine Presence</b> <b>was again
dwelling in the mishkan.<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='color:black;mso-bidi-language:HE'>The mishkan, serving as the center for
ritual, witnessing the presence of God, and the place for meeting the Divine,
defines <b>the boundaries of 'the holy' and its essence </b>differently. Its power
rested not in its architectural splendor or in the ground upon which it stood.
Its strength emanates from its essence, from its position in the center of the
encampment and from its rededication each time it was reassembled to execute the
functions designated for it. From sources in the Talmud and Tosefta in
Massechet Sotah it seems that the mishkan was finally interred in one of the
subterranean chambers which lay under the <st1:City w:st="on">Temple</st1:City>
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.
This depositing of the mishkan there signifies the end of its temporal role. It
is written that &quot;the enemies of the Jewish people did not derive any
benefit from the creations of Moshe (and his staff)&quot;. All the implements
made by Moshe in the desert, (the planks, the hooks, the boards and the sockets
et alia) survived for hundreds of years and even afterwards were never burned
but were hidden and archived. Paradoxically, the temporary structure survived
for a long time, while it was the magnificent <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City> in all its splendor and glory that was
eventually incinerated and destroyed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
style='color:black;mso-bidi-language:HE'>The required activity entailed in the
building and dismantling of the 'ohel moed', its relative lightness because it
had to portable, stand in contrast to our conception and visualization of
magnificent sanctuaries from different eras and sites around the world, bestows
an additional value to the mishkan, that perhaps one could adopt as a personal
and spiritual ideal for one's ever-renewable holy service as one journeys
through life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

without any specific mention of the building of the mishkan, I say that at the
beginning of the psalm and at its conclusion there is an allusion to the
mishkan in the phrase <b>&quot;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all
generations.&quot; </b>Similarly, in his prayer at the dedication of the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Temple</st1:City></st1:place>, Solomon <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Kings1,8,27)</span> '&quot;<b>But will God really
live on earth? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less
this <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City> I
have built! 'Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place...</b> You are the
dwelling place of the world and the world is not a place and dwelling for You';
how can one even conceive of the idea to build a building in which You shall
dwell? Additionally it says: '<b>Before the mountains were born, before you
gave birth to the earth and the world, from beginning to end, you are God' </b>and
were the Almighty to dwell in a place, it would have been impossible to do so
before the creation of the world! Ergo, <b>the world</b> <b>is not His place! </b>As
a matter of fact, He is the dwelling place for the world and it is illogical to
assume that He would command him (Solomon) to build for Him a dwelling. To
resolve this seeming contradiction, the verse states: 'You turn man back into
dust And say, &quot;Return, O children of men &quot;God was compelled to waive
His dignity and make for Himself an earthly dwelling in order to pardon Am
Yisrael for the sin of the golden calf, for according to Chazal <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tanchuma Pikudei 5)</span> <b>the entire mishkan was
an atonement for the sin of the golden calf.</b><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Children of Israel were
commanded-'Take for Me Terumah...' Terumah that was required for the building
of the mishkan. In the execution of this command, it says-'whoever is of
generous heart' shall bring his contribution. The midrash comments that in
paying close attention to the text, the<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>
term 'of generous heart' is used when the purpose is favorable- to enlist the
people for heavenly tasks, to build the mishkan- every man who is generous of
heart brought his contribution ; it is not applicable to the entire nation nor
to the congregation nor to every community. In contrast, when the people ran to
worship that which they conceived to be divine, the golden calf, it says ' <u>the
entire people</u> divested themselves of their golden nose-rings'! Therefore, when
it comes to doing a good thing, the text reads 'every man of generous heart'; when
it comes to sinful acts, the text reads 'the entire people.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>Service of God does not emanate from a natural impulse from within man;
it requires spiritual effort to overpower his natural tendencies and to accept
upon himself the 'yoke of heaven'; for 'avodah zarah' man is naturally inclined...

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>The term &quot;filled&quot;
is used in the sense of the perfection of an exalted and purposeful thing.
Likewise, it is written: 'The earth is filled with His glory&quot;- meaning

with wisdom of heart&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Exod. xxxv. 35)</span>

dir=LTR></span>) of his glory&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Isa. vi. 4)</span>,&quot;
All the earth gives evidence of His perfection,&quot; i.e. leads to a knowledge
of Him. Thus also &quot;The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Exod. xl. 34)</span>: and, in fact, every application
of the word to God must be interpreted in this manner; and not that He has a
body occupying space. If, on the other hand, you prefer to think that in this
passage by<span dir=RTL></span><span dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>&quot;the glory of the Lord,&quot; a
certain light was created for this purpose, it should be understood, that such

say, that the Rambam leaves it to the comprehension of the student and reader,
according to his intellectual level, and depth of his faith. In other words, if
one's faith requires a demonstration of the awareness of God, he is permitted
to interpret the verse as pointing to a visual manifestation similar to what
Israel perceived, if however, the person is of a more advanced level of
comprehension and is steeped in his faith, and does not require any concrete expression
, but understands that the phrase 'glory of God' is but a poetic expression for
the worship of the Divine in the sanctuary.</p>

constantly be found in the presence of their deceased and may excessively

their defilement in order to prevent the fashioning of wineskin, mats, or
utensils from the bones for that would constitute a denigration of a human
being. This is reflected in the teaching of Chazal: &quot;Why is human skin
considered ritually unclean? In order to prevent a man from using the skins of
his parents to make mats! Why are human bones ritually impure? To forbid the
making of spoons from the bones of ones parents! The greater the affection-the
