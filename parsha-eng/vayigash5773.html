<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'><span
class=GramE>Interpretation.</span> <span class=GramE>A relative concept.</span>
Sometimes different interpretations of the same text or the same narrative can
lead in completely different directions, to different beliefs, to different
attitudes, to different occurrences. In Parashat Vayeshev we find Joseph
dreaming two dreams. These famous dreams lead, in some degree, to the
intensification of the hatred of the brothers for Joseph. True, this hatred was
grounded in Yaakov's overt and obvious preference for Joseph over his brothers
and in the deteriorating relations which existed because of this
differentiation and aloofness (&quot;And Joseph brought ill report of them to
their father&quot;, &quot;And <span class=SpellE>Yisrael</span> loved Joseph
more than all his sons, for he was the child of his old age, and he made him an
ornamental tunic. And his brothers saw it was he their father loved more than
all his brothers, and they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him&quot;).
The dreams added fuel to this fire of hatred, bringing it more into the open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>It is
interesting to note how the dreams are described in the parasha. Already at the
time of their telling they are interpreted by Yaakov and the brothers - and
perhaps even by Joseph himself - as condescending dreams which presume
superiority of the dreamer over all the others - including those who, even in a
dream, should not be legitimate targets of haughty attitude - his father Yaakov
and his departed mother Rachel (&quot;Do you mean to reign over us, do you mean
to rule us?&quot;, &quot;And his father rebuked him and said to him, &quot;What
is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall we really come, I and your mother
and your brothers, to bow before you to the ground?&quot;)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Joseph, renowned
as a master of dreams, does not only dream. He also interprets dreams. He is
able to read them. Were someone to examine Joseph's two dreams using Joseph's
keys, he would save himself considerable distress. The Talmud <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tractate Berachot, Chap. 9</span>) teaches &quot;All
dreams follow the mouth [=interpretation]&quot;; &quot;A dream not interpreted
is like a letter unopened&quot; - the interpreter of the dreams clearly has
great influence. This influence may be considered to be psychological influence
or cosmic influence, but in any case, ultimately, the interpretation affects
reality. Such is certainly the case against a background of highly charged
relationships; every word and every nuance of a word becomes dramatic as it
contributes to existing tension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Every time
that Joseph interprets a dream for someone else, and in the dreams appears a
numerical function, Joseph interprets the dream as <b>time-dependant</b>. <span
class=GramE>Three baskets, three days (the dreams of the chief cupbearer and
the chief baker) seven cows, seven sheaves, seven years (Pharaoh's dream).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>As we study Joseph's
two dreams, we see that in his second dream appear thirteen heavenly bodies,
the sun, the moon and eleven stars. <b>He was seventeen years old when he dreamt
his dream. He is thirty years old when he stands before Pharaoh. </b>Thirteen
years pass before his dream is realized. Yaakov, captive to his love for Rachel
even after her death, sees only her when her beloved son comes and relates his
dream. <span class=GramE>Her and himself.</span> <span class=GramE>He and
Rachel and eleven sons.</span> And so, into his son's simple dream he weaves
his own dream, Yaakov's dream. And so he weaves his son's prisoner tunic, the
ornamental tunic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Let us return
for a moment to Joseph's first dreams. The dream is about sheaves, about bread,
food, sustenance. His brothers' sheaves are bent. They cannot bear the burden.
He stands in the center. One can also understand the picture as sheaves bowing,
and this, of course, is how the brothers understood this dream, but, in the
overall perspective of the story, one can see Joseph becoming a provider
thirteen years from the day he dreamt his dreams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>When Joseph
finally reveals himself to his brothers, he said: &quot;I am Joseph your
brother whom you sold into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>...
do not be pained... because for sustenance God has sent me before you.&quot; In
other words, in the atmosphere which existed between us then, we understood the
dream as delusions of grandeur and a desire to rule over you (which you
attempted to disrupt through extreme and violent measures, also perhaps because
of our family history) but now, the &quot;divine&quot; interpretation of the
dream is the mission, the responsibility &quot;to make you a remnant on earth
and to preserve life&quot;; this is to say, a complex responsibility primarily of
being a provider - to attend to your sustenance. <span class=GramE>A ruler, but
not necessarily a ruler over you in the sense in which we &quot;read&quot; the
dreams in our youth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt'>Joseph is a
complex figure. He is a handsome man who finds favor in the eyes of those who
see him and because of <span class=GramE>this,</span> he arouses powerful envy,
Envy so intense as to endanger his life. He is forced to mature and ultimately
he merits deciphering that which is hidden in his dreams also as a powerful
ruler who understands the divine dimension within himself. Thereby he turns the
dream once again into an open letter which facilitates dialogue and
forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>...there&nbsp;is one who says
that the number seventy is an approximation, and that there <span class=GramE>were</span>
sixty-nine. That exegete is mistaken, since we find that he had thirty-three
sons and daughters, but they were [only] thirty-two. The&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>midrash</span></span>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE>Yocheved</span>&nbsp;was born between the walls is also strange.
Why didn't Scripture mention the wonder performed for her sake - that [if we
assume that&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Yocheved</span>&nbsp;was born as Jacob's
family entered&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>]
she gave birth to Moses at the age of one hundred and thirty!? [After all,] it
is mentioned that Sarah gave birth when she was [&quot;only&quot;] ninety years
old! As if this were not troubling enough, the authors of the&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE><i>piyutim</i></span>&nbsp;[hymns] wrote in a song for&nbsp;<span
class=SpellE>Simhat</span>&nbsp;Torah, &quot;My mother&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Yocheved</span>,
be consoled for my death, and she was two hundred and fifty years old [when I -
Moses - died], and&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Ahiya</span>&nbsp;lived so and so
many years.&quot; This is [merely] an&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>aggadah</span>&nbsp;or
a lone opinion. I think that Jacob is included in the calculation [of the
seventy souls], as if to say all of his sons and daughters plus himself were
thirty-three. The proof for this is that it first says&nbsp;<i>Jacob and his
children</i>. If someone argues against me that it says,<i>&nbsp;Now all those
descended from Jacob were seventy souls</i>&nbsp;<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Shemot</span>&nbsp;1:5)</span>, it is enough [to answer him] that
Scripture did not hesitate to leave out one from seventy when it said,<i>&nbsp;These
are Jacob's sons who were born to him in&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Padan</span>&nbsp;Aram&nbsp;</i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>&nbsp;35:26)</span>&nbsp;even
though Benjamin was not born there. There are two additional [textual]
witnesses to this matter. One is that it says,<i>&nbsp;And these are the names
of the children of Israel who were coming to Egypt: Jacob and his sons Jacob's
firstborn was Reuben</i>&nbsp;<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>&nbsp;46:8)</span>; here Jacob is mentioned as
belonging to the&nbsp;<i>children of Israel</i>, since Scripture used language
appropriate to the majority [of the people involved]. The second witness
is&nbsp;<i>all the souls of the house of Jacob who came to&nbsp;<st1:country-region
w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>&nbsp;were seventy</i>&nbsp;<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Bereishit</span>&nbsp;46:27)</span>;
but Manasseh and Ephraim did not come to&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>&nbsp;-
they were already there and had been born there; later it is written&nbsp;<span
class=GramE><i>With</i></span><i>&nbsp;seventy souls, Your forefathers
descended to&nbsp;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place></i>&nbsp;<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>&nbsp;10:22)</span>,
but those two had not descended. This verse also serves as evidence that Jacob
was included in the calculation,&nbsp;<b>because he had a soul, and that is
main thing</b>.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

naturally be the first question. But they will fearlessly declare the
unpleasant truth; the Egyptians' abhorrence of their <span class=GramE>occupation,</span>

survival for this tribe which is destined to pass the days in isolation. As long
