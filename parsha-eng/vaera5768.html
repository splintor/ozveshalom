class=SpellE>Eichhorn</span> and others following him believe that the blood
and all the other plagues were natural phenomena that reoccur annually in
Egypt, and that while Moses intended for Pharaoh to understand that the Lord,
God of the Hebrews, causes all these things to happen and that He rules over
the entire earth, the waters of the Nile flood the land in the month of Tammuz
and look thick and red (be it because of the redness of the soil in <span
class=SpellE>Kush</span>, from whence they originate, or because of the many
small creatures that make the water look red in other countries as well,
causing the masses to believe that blood had fallen from heaven), and they
stink and are foul to drink... Moses could not have thought to turn the king's
mind towards him through [taking credit for] natural events that take place
every year without producing some miracle that departed from the ways of the
world. It is known that even when performing miracles God likes to preserve
something of the ways of nature. Thus, in the plagues of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place> I believe it could be that
something like them occurred naturally, some in one year, some in another. However,
in that year they all took place together and each of them involved some new
and unnatural element. Thus, in <span class=GramE>the</span> case of the blood,
the fact that the redness of the water was so foul that it killed the fish was
a new phenomenon which we do not find mentioned in the accounts of travelers. This
proves that the waters were befouled and damaged much more badly than in other
years. It was unnatural, as if the water had actually turned into blood.</p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Humility is one of Moses' chief qualities. When
Moses' brother and sister spoke disparagingly of him in parashat <span
class=SpellE>Beha'alotkha</span>, the Torah responds: <b><i>Now this man Moses
was exceedingly <span class=SpellE>anav</span> </i>[<i>humble</i>]<i>, more so
than any person on the face of the earth</i></b> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bamidbar
12)</span>. The <span class=SpellE><i>Shir</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>HaKavod</span>
</i>[&quot;<span class=SpellE><i>Anim</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Zemirot</span></i>&quot;]
uses the word <span class=SpellE><i>anav</i></span> as an appellation for
Moses: &quot;He showed the knot of the tefillin to the <span class=SpellE><i>anav</i></span>.&quot;
We find further examples of Moses' humility: when Joshua asked to jail <span
class=SpellE>Eldad</span> and <span class=SpellE>Medad</span>, who had been
prophesizing in the camp, Moses tells him, <i><span style='mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'>If only <span class=GramE>all the</span> Lord's people were prophets,
that the Lord would bestow His spirit upon them!</span></i><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'> </span><span class=GramE><span

style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>.</span></span><span style='mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'> That is to say, instead of being jealous for his own unique prophetic
status, Moses is prepared to have others share the prophetic role. Humility is
usually viewed as a positive trait. As the <span class=SpellE>Amora</span>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: &quot;Humility is the greatest of all&quot; </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(<span class=SpellE>Avoda</span>
<span class=SpellE>Zara</span> 20b)</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Moses'
humility comes to light from the very beginning of his career as a prophet. Immediately
after God first reveals Himself to him, Moses modestly replies: <i>&quot;<b>Who
am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should take the children of <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>?</b>&quot;</i> </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Shemot 3:11)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. He tries again and again to convince God
that he is unworthy to speak before Pharaoh and the Israelites: &quot;</span><i>I
am not a man of words</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(4:10)</span>, and, <i>send
now [Your message] with whom <span class=GramE>You</span> would send</i>&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(4:13)</span>. Even after entering <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place> and speaking to Pharaoh, he
tells God, &quot;<i>Behold, I am of closed lips; so how will Pharaoh hearken to
me?</i>&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(6:30)</span>. Moses is so humble
that he is not prepared to protest to Pharaoh against the enslavement of the
Israelites in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>God's responds strongly to Moses' humility: <i><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>&quot;Who <a name="OLE_LINK2">gave man a
mouth</a>... Is it not I, the Lord? So now, go! I will be with your mouth, and
I will instruct you what you shall speak&quot; </span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(6:11-12)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. Later, the Torah even says that,</span><i>
the Lord's wrath was kindled against Moses</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(6:14)</span>.
When he relinquished the respect due him in Bamidbar, Moses' humility was
considered a virtue. However, when Moses becomes meek and flees his moral duty,
his humility enflames God's anger against him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;

bondage (<i>and he saw their troubles</i> - <span class=SpellE><span

and the mission with which God charges him in its wake, are not concerned with
Moses' personal honor. As a result, he has no right to refuse his mission and
to avoid registering his protest with Pharaoh. Protest against injustice is not
a matter of personal taste or opinion, and humility does not excuse one from
giving voice to such protest.</p>

misbehavior lightly. His humility made him view moral truth as a personal

under discussion is clearly immoral, even when people advocate racism and
violence, presenting them as belonging to the Torah. We have erased the
commandment <i>surely rebuke your fellow</i> and say instead <i>let each man do
what is right in his own eyes</i>. Every opinion, no matter how repugnant, is a
&quot;controversy for the sake of Heaven&quot; and never &quot;the controversy
of Korah and his congregation.&quot; Since truth is seen as something personal,

miracles he performed; one who believes on the basis of miracles is spiritually
deficient, for it is possible that the omen was produced in secret and through
sorcery. The signs he produced in the desert were to serve specific needs, but
not for the purpose of offering proof of his prophecy. In order to drown the
Egyptians, he split the sea and engulfed them. We needed food, he brought down
the manna. They were thirsty, he split the rock. <span class=SpellE>Korah's</span>
band rejected him, the earth swallowed them. <span class=GramE>And so with all
the other miracles.</span> And why did we believe in him at the Sinai
revelation? Our eyes - not those of strangers - saw; our ears - not those of
others - heard the fire and the sounds and torches. And he approached the mist,
and the voice spoke out to him, as we listened: &quot;Moses, Moses - go and
tell them such and such.&quot; And so Moses says, <i>Face to face did He speak
to you all</i> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Devarim
5:4)</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>, and it is written, <i>It
was not with your fathers that the Lord cut this covenant </i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Devarim 5:4)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. And from where do we know that the
revelation at Sinai was the sole proof of the unblemished truth of his
prophecy? It is written, <i>I will come to you in a thick cloud, in order that
the people may hear when I speak with you and so trust in you forever after </i></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Shemot 19:9)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>; from this we deduce that prior to that
point, they did not believe in him with everlasting faith - their faith was
subject to thought and deliberation... From this we learn that whichever
prophet appears after our teacher Moses will not gain our trust because of a
miracle alone (&quot;If he performs a miracle we shall heed him in whatever he
says&quot;), but because of God's commandment which Moses commanded us in the
Torah, saying that if he gives a sign, <i>to him, shall you listen</i> </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Devarim 18:15)</span><span
style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. Just as He commanded us to pass judgment
on the basis of the testimony of two witnesses, even though we cannot be
certain whether their testimony is true or false, so are we commanded to obey
the prophet, whether his sign be true or produced by tricks or sorcery.
Therefore, if a prophet rises up and performs great signs and omens, but seeks
to deny the prophecy of Moses our teacher, we do not heed him, and we know for
a certainty that those signs are sorcery and secretly prepared, for the
prophecy of Moses our teacher is not dependent upon signs, that we should weigh
these signs against those signs, but with our own eyes we saw it and with our
own ears we heard it, just as he did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
