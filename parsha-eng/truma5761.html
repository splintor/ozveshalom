<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "<I>And this is the contribution that you are to take from them . . ."  -  </I>to the exception of one who contributes that which is not his. <FONT SIZE=2>(Yerushalmi, Terumot 1:1)</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GIVING &ndash; EQUALLY AND HUMBLY</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is another explanation why the first two contributions (<I>terumot) </I>are ordered specifically in God's name, whereas the third is not. Wherever we find humility and submission among mortals, there we find the secret might of Holy One, who dwells among the oppressed and the meek; but wherever there is the slightest hint of pride, the Holy One refuses to bestow his name.  Therefore, the first two contributions, which were given equally by all, for "<I>The rich are not to pay more, and the poor are not to pay less", </I>and no one can boast "My contribution is greater than yours",  these God attributed to himself:</P>
<OL>

<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The first is preceded by "<I>And they may take <B>Me</B></I> &ndash;<B> to my Name. </B> We have already explained, at the beginning of Parashat Miketz, and on the verse "<I>Every place where I call my name to be recalled I will come to you and bless you," </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Shemot 20:21)  - </FONT>every letter of His great name points to humility. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The second contribution is termed <I>"my contribution".</LI></P></OL>
</OL>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the use to which the contributions were put offers the same message. Just as all contributions were equal, forestalling any boasting, so were the boards &ndash; all of equal length.  They were at the bottom of the entire edifice, a trodden threshold, foundations of the entire building . <I>"Those who fashion them shall become like them" </I>&ndash; just as the givers were equal in their contributions, none having excuse for pride over his fellow, so were these boards acquired  by  the contributions, symbolic of humility, for humility is the foundation of the building upon which the entire House of Israel is established.  They are called <B><I>adanim</B> </I>&ndash; which hint at <B>mastery and rule</B> [Trans. note:  <I>adan</I> means board; <I>adon </I> means master], because whoever makes of himself a trodden threshold below, is appointed master above, for whoever lowers himself, the Holy One raises him us and makes him the foundation and support for the entire building, just like these boards which were foundation and support for all the edifice. And so the <B><I>nasi</B> &ndash; (</I>highest official)<I> </I>is so called such because <B>he carries the others</B>, for they all depend on him [Trans. note: The Hebrew for "high official" and "carry"  share a common root].</P>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Charity for the poor is greater than the building of the Beit Hamikdash" &ndash; so, according to the Netziv, is the opinion of Rav Ahai Gaon, author of the She'iltot, who derives the laws of charity from "<I>And they shall take me (li) a raised-contribution (teruma)." </I>Even though the subject of the verse is not charity, the author of the She'iltot, following our Sages, is of the opinion that the rules of charity are analogous to the building of the Beit Hamikdash.  Therefore he understood the word "<I>li" </I>in the sense of  "on my behalf", in keeping with the Bavli (Bava Batra 10a): Said Rabbi  Yochanan, How are we to understand the verse (Proverbs 19) "<I>He who is generous to the poor makes a loan to the Lord"?  </I>Had it not appeared explicitly in Scripture, who would have dared to say it . . for 'a borrower is slave to the lender!"   That is to say, that one who gives charity, lends &ndash; as it were -  to the Holy One! This, according to the author of the She'iltot, is the meaning of  "<I>and they shall take for me a contribution." </I>The Netziv, commentating on the She'iltot, goes a step further &ndash; the author of the She'iltot allows himself to explicate a verse dealing with a contribution to the Temple, constructing a <I>kal vachomer </I>proof<I> </I>[argument <I>a fortiori</I>)  built on an <I>a priori</I> assumption  . . . "if so with contribution to the Temple, how much more so with charity" &ndash; indicating that he opines that the <I>mitzva</I> of <I>tzedaka </I>is more important than that of building the Temple!      In similar fashion the Tosafists explain the words of the Talmud (<FONT SIZE=2>Bava Batra 9a) </FONT> "And Rav Assi said: Charity is equal to all the <I>mitzvot</I>, for it is written: <I>"We have laid upon ourselves obligations" </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Nehemiah 19:33) </FONT> -- it is not written "obligation" (in the singular), but "<I>obligations\".  </I>The Tosafists noted that the quoted verse has to no connection whatever to charity, and they write "Even though this verse is in reference to the House of God, i.e., restoration of the Temple &ndash; "<I>kol shekayn tzedakkah" &ndash; </I>certainly such is the case with charity."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The priority of charity over the building of the Beit Hamikdash finds expression in midrash. The subject of the Haftara for Parashat Teruma (when it does not occur on Parashat Zachor) is the construction of the Beit Hamikdash by King Shelomo. We are well acquainted with the sentence imposed on King David "<I>You have shed much blood and fought great battles; you shall not build a house for My name" </I><FONT SIZE=2>(Chronicles I, 22:8). </FONT>Chronicles II relates that David devoted tremendous effort and resources to prepare a treasury to facilitate the building by his son. Thus we find him publicly boasting at his son's coronation (Chronicles I, 29:2-3): <I>"I have spared no effort to lay up for the House of my God gold for golden objects, and silver for silver . . . Besides, out of my solicitude for the House of my God, I gave over my private hoard of gold and silver to the House of my God &ndash; in addition to all that I laid aside for the holy House." </I> What became of his "private hoard"  -- the treasure and the building materials which David had prepared for his son's construction of the Temple? It is possible that <B>King Solomon never made use of them!</B> So is recorded (<FONT SIZE=2>Kings I, 7:51): "</FONT><I>When all the work that King Shelomo had done in the House of the Lord was completed, Shelomo brought in the sacred donations of his father David &ndash; the silver, the gold, and the  vessels &ndash; and deposited them in the treasury of the House of the Lord."  </I>A plain reading (<I>pshat) </I>of the text would seem to indicate that the verse is dealing with the surplus which was brought to the treasury, but an alternative understanding might be that no use whatever was made of it.  Rashi, commenting on the parallel verse in Chronicles (II, 5:1) supports the latter alternative; for Scripture records that of all of his father's spoils, Shelomo utilized only the copper <FONT SIZE=2>(II 18:8),  </FONT>yet  no mention is made of the copper in the Kings I narrative! From this it may be deduced that Shelomo did not utilize the gold and silver which his father David had set aside as "private hoard".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>An explanation for this is offered by commentators drawing upon a <I>drash</I> to be found in Rashi which he credits: "I heard from my rabbis".  We quote here from the Pesikta Rabbati <FONT SIZE=2>(Ish Shalom edition, Parasha 6, beginning with "<I>Davar acher v'tishlam</I>)</FONT>: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those interpret as praise, and there are those who do so  in deprecation. In praise: David had requested that it be so. He said to Him: Master of the Universe, I foresee in my prophecy that the Temple is to be destroyed, and all which I have set aside is from the idolators' homes which I devastated, [let it not be used in the construction] lest the nations say "What did David think, that he could destroy the house of our gods and construct a house for (his) god &ndash; our gods will rise up and reap their revenge and destroy (his) house of god!" Therefore he prayed that Shelomo not need them. And those who interpret as deperecation:  In David's reign there occurred a three-year famine,  and David had a number of treasuries full of silver and gold which he was saving for the construction of the Beit Hamikdash. He should have spent it to save lives, but he did not do so. God said to him, My children are dying of hunger and <B>you are hoarding money to construct a building</B>. You should have  been saving lives &ndash; you did not do so. (I swear) by your life, Shelomo will not utilize any of it: "<I>And he brought [deposited them in the treasury of the House of the Lord] the work and Shelomo did not need them, and all the work was done."  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ralbag offers an explanation similar to the "deprecative" approach: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"It would seem that this is the reason why hdid not commence with the building of the Temple immediately upon ascending the throne, for (only) in the fourth year he began the construction . . . and this was so that he could build from his own resources, not from the treasures which his father David had consecrated to God, as if this were directed by God who did not want David to build it, because he had shed much blood. So He did not agree that it should be built from that which David had accumulated from his battle spoils. But Shelomo, who was man of peace, and had wealth which he had collected in situations of peace, was chosen by God to build -- with what he had amassed in a state of peace."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Halacha, however, as formulated in the Shulchan Aruch <FONT SIZE=2>(Yoreh Deah, 249, 16),  </FONT> presents a different opinion with regard to the order of priorities "There are some who say that <B>the mitzvah of a synagogue takes precedence over the mitzvah of charity,</B> and that the mitzvah of charity for  youths learning Torah or <B>for sick paupers</B> takes precedence over the mitzvah of a synagogue."  The source for this ruling is a responsum of the Maharik <FONT SIZE=2>(Article 128)  </FONT>which is based upon a story in the Talmud Yerushalmi <FONT SIZE=2>(Peah 8, Shekalim 5)</FONT>: An Amora boasted about the great sums of money </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">which his fathers had contributed to the construction of a synagogue. His friend asked him: "How many lives did your fathers donate --  were there no youths in need of Torah instruction, or sick people lying in rubbish?" From here Rav Shmuel derives that it is better to give charity for youngsters to learn Torah or for <B>sick</B> paupers than to give it to a synagogue."  The Maharik derives a ruling from an exact reading: "Because the Yerushalmi talks about <B>"sick people lying in rubbish",</B> and Rav Shmuel refers to <B>indigent sick -  </B>rather than referring to the<B> poor </B>in general<B>, </B>we may conclude that if they are not<B> sick</B>, but just poor,<B> it is preferable to donate charity to the synagogue."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that the proof from the Yerushalmi is not incontestable. The Gaon  of Vilna remarks "not proven". The Gra understood that the midrash in the Pesikta  and the above-quoted Tosafot disagree with the Maharik. He adds that the source of the disagreement may lie in variant readings of the  Bavli <FONT SIZE=2>(Bava Batra 3a). </FONT>In the <I>sugya</I> as reported in the accepted text of the Bavli, the Amoraim rule that it is forbidden to demolish a synagogue before a new one is built. A question is raised: What if the necessary funds have already been collected? "Said Ravina to Rav Ashi: What is the law if the money has already been collected?" He answered: "Perhaps a need for ransoming prisoners will arise."  In other words, even in such a case it is forbidden to demolish the older synagogue, lest the need arise for the community to ransom prisoners, and the funds will have to be diverted to that need.  This leads to the conclusion that ordinary  cases of  charity  do  not  take precedence  over  building  a </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">synagogue.   But   manuscripts  and   some   Rishonim  present  a  different  reading: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Perhaps need for another <I>mitzva</I> will arise, and the funds will be spent on it." <FONT SIZE=2>(See Dikdukei Sofrim  ibid.,  and Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 242:1) </FONT> From this we see that even other <I>mitzvot</I>, and certainly the <I>mitzva</I> of charity, take precedence over expenditure for synagogue construction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Thus far, we have related to one aspect of order of priorities, but at the  fulcrum of the ideological discussion stands the question of harmony between our order of priorities and that of the Master of the World.  Who can count the tears, the demonstrations, the educational and organizational resources expended for our sacred House by the religious-national community in Israel  --  and who can count how many tears have been shed, how many demonstrations held, how many educational and organizational resources spent by this community for the alleviation of the distress and exploitation of foreign workers or of Arab workers from Yesha, or to deal with other burning social issues, such as female slavery, family violence, social inequalities, or the evils of war?  Perhaps our order of priorities  reflects the exact opposite of the Master of the World's order of priorities? Perhaps the higher we place the synagogue and the Beit Hamikdash on our agenda, He deletes them from His agenda. "The Temple Mount is in our hands!"  --  but it seems that we have never been less deserving  of the privilege of seeing its rebuilding &ndash; <B>Zion shall be saved in the judgement;  her repentant ones, in charity.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so the positive commandment to wipe out the memory of Amalek, as is written, "<I>You are to blot out the name of Amalek", </I> and the positive commandment to constantly remember his wicked deeds and <FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)"> </FONT>his ambush<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)"> </FONT>with intent to intensify his enmity, as is written, <I>"Remember what Amalek did to <B>you"  -- </B></I>via tradition they learned: "<B><I>Remember</B>" </I>&ndash; orally, "<B><I>Do not forget" &ndash; </B></I>in your heart, it is forbidden to forget his enmity and his hatred.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rambam's preceding halacha, <FONT SIZE=2>(5:4), </FONT>dealing the commandment to destroy the seven nations, is  concluded with the words "and their memory no longer exists", a statement based on the ruling of the Tosefta <FONT SIZE=2>(Kiddushin 5:6) : </FONT>"When Sanheriv rose and mixed all the nations."  This sweeping assertion negates any operational racist understanding of the <I>mitzva</I> of blotting out the memory of Amalek &ndash; because we cannot ascertain with certainty who is descended from whom.  Therefore Amalek becomes an abstract concept which relates to all human evil; it is a metaphor for anyone who exploits the vulnerability of another person or another nation in order to overcome him</P><DIR>

<FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P></DIR>

</DIR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The practical expression of this <I>mitzvah</I> <FONT SIZE=2>(Shulchan Aruch, Orach Hayim 785)</FONT> is the reading of Parashat "Zachor" on the Shabbat preceding Purim:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[2] On the second Shabbat we take out two scrolls; from one we read the portion of the week, and from the second we read: <I>"Remember what Amalek did to you" </I>and the <I>maftir</I> reads: "<I>I am exacting the penalty for what Amalek did to Israel."</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[7] There are some who rule that the public readings of Parashat Zachor and Parashat Parah Aduma are Torah obligations (<I>mideorayta</I>). Therefore those who dwell in a community where there is no minyan are obligated to come to a place where there is a minyan on these Shabbatot in order to hear these parashot which are Torah obligations.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author of the Mishna Berura <FONT SIZE=2>(785:1) </FONT>elaborates on the significance of the <I>mitzva</I>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second is Parashat Zachor </B>&ndash; to recall Amalek's act, and we read about it on the Shabbat preceding Purim in order to juxtapose it with the deed plotted by Amalek's seed, and in order to precede the performance with the remembrance of the obligation to blot out Amalek, as is written:  "<I>These days are recalled and observed".</P>
</I><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B><FONT FACE="Tahoma (Hebrew)" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Thus we are obligated &ndash; by mouth and in our hearts &ndash; to remember and not to forget that which Amalek did to <B>us.  </B>Our memories as victims of violence and persecution are a two-edged sword. We sometimes find many of our people who have accumulated emotions of hate and vengeance against whoever belongs to a nation or group which has hurt us. We sometimes hear cries such  as "Death to Arabs" or "Nation of lepers!" &ndash; expressions of anger, following murderous attacks. Feelings of rage and the desire for revenge are natural and understandable in moments of crisis, and one cannot be judged in his moment of anguish. But it seems that the <B><I>mitzva</B></I> has a different meaning, because the Torah does not "command" us to feel that which is naturally felt. The Torah does not enjoin us to love our children. On the other hand, it does charge us <I>"Love the stranger."</I>  The Torah seems to command us to make every </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Especially in these difficult d, and in lieu of the painful memory of other Purim days in which the memories of our patriarchs and matriarchs in the Me'arat HaMachpela were desecrated, we must remember and not forget that which was done &ndash; and, God forbid, may still be done &ndash; to <B>us</B>  by Amalek . . . if we allow him to hurt us.</P>
