contributed nothing to the calf, as explained by our rabbis of blessed memory,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Images which
man creates have their source close to home. Having to express emotions, or abstract
ideas, or perhaps feelings towards a subject - and the words are missing from
his mouth - he borrows from his familiar world in order to explain the unknown.
Thus is a creation constructed in all its dimensions, and so the spirit of man
is afforded new spaces in which to travel - words covered by a mantle of might.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Man's
relationships to God, composed of awe and closeness, of fear and love, of
intimacy and total ignorance, are transmitted in the Jewish dialogue through
verbal similes and practical symbols. The ban on expressing the image of God in
his physical form, &quot;He has no semblance - He is bodiless&quot; led to
practical expression of feelings toward Him as a substitute for occupation with
his essence. The pair of cherubim growing out of the external covering of the
pair of tablets of the covenant expresses the intimate connection between <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
and He who gave them the Torah. &quot;Like a man embracing his consort&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Yoma</span> 54b</span>), that is
to say, like a man embraced by his beloved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>This image of
the lover-beloved relationship is found on different levels in Biblical texts.
The intimacy of modest relations inside the home, in the holy of holies,
covered with sealskins** during the tabernacle's disassembly and wanderings,
but &quot;All know why the bride has entered the bridal canopy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>This image
multi-faceted - love - the most noble of emotions, can easily turn into the
most vulgar frivolity... refined behavior becomes coarse... caress turns into
cruelty, love into self-centered demand... love of God turns into idol worship...
sacred into profane. <span class=GramE>The opposite of closeness - hatred.</span>
The lover-beloved, man-God set is not neutral. It involves the entire soul, and
leads man to externalize the depths of his soul, for good and for bad. The most
powerful emotional experiences are played out on the pitch of these relationships.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>How are they
positioned? Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Yochanan</span> and Rabbi <span
class=SpellE>Elazar</span> answer: One says, each faces his brother and the
other says they face inward. And according to the one who says 'each facing his
brother', is it not written &quot;facing inward&quot;! There is no
contradiction - here it speaks of when <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region>
does the will of the Omnipresent, here where <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place> does not do the will of the
Omnipresent. And according to the one who says that they faced the chamber, is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'><b>Here [it
speaks of ] when Israel does the will of the Omnipresent - </b>they face each other,
as exemplified by the love of male and female who love each other. A sign that
the Holy One loves Israel, and at the beginning they were created face to face
so that the Holy Presence rests upon Israel and Israel will do the will of the Omnipresent,
and when they fail to do so, by miraculous means, their faces turned inward&quot;

<span class=GramE>Direct extension to myself, my image, my spouse.</span> The privacy
of relations with God built an inner world, hidden from all and recognized by
its scope, only within the soul. God's lack of physicality transfers the relationships
to spiritual planes as it constructs a kind of completion to man's spiritual
portion, a completion best symbolized by the soul's unification with the
partner, a sort of area shared and unseen but very tangible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>In the image
of the Lord He created him, male and female he created them <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid) </span>The <i>&quot;couple-<span class=SpellE>ness</span>&quot;

you, that the one secret can be seen only through two&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Ibn</span> Ezra short version. <span
class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 25:20) </span>is the foundation for deep
experiences. From the traits of the single God who reveals himself to the eyes
of man as two, as material and form, through the electron in which the secret
of one is revealed only through two, through the partnership in which is
revealed the secret of the singles, in their embrace...this is the source of
their strength. Male and female, each partner in the couple standing by
himself, with his different attributes, his unique nature and viewpoint and
reaching full expression through the partnership, through the mutual
supplementing of attributes. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>
cannot do without the Holy One, and the Holy One cannot do without His people.
He lacks her and she is missing him. Sometimes He is the male and she is the
woman and sometimes He is the beloved female and they are the beloved male. There
is deep equality between the two parts which supplement each other, who yearn
for each other...'the voice of my beloved approaches'. His life is incomplete
without her, and his secret cannot be seen in the chill of his loneliness and
from where shall she come and who will come to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>No other image

me for adjudication, in order that everything be peacefully settled, and
everyone should know what is his, and what is not - and only then he informed
them of the matter of donation, saying &quot;<i>Take from among you gifts to

Shalom is a movement dedicated to the advancement of a civil society in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
It is committed to promoting the ideals of tolerance, pluralism, and justice,
concepts that have always been central to Jewish tradition and law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Oz <span class=SpellE>Veshalom-Netivot</span>
Shalom shares a deep attachment to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Israel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
and it no less views peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews
have both the religious and the national obligation to support the pursuit of
peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and
just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but
an imperative.</p>
