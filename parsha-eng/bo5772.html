hardening of Pharaoh's heart. Again and again it is difficult to accept the

Be He. Similar to the heretics mentioned by Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Yochanan</span>,
we want to protest and say: &quot;But he was unable to repent!?&quot; <span
class=GramE><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Midrash</span> <span
class=SpellE>Rabba</span>, <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 13, section 3)</span>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>How many nibs
have been broken on the issue of freedom of choice vs. the hardening of Pharaoh's
heart… and I confess: I really do not know Scripture's intentions, but, having
already touched upon the subject, I would like to develop the <span
class=SpellE>Midrash's</span> statement, further developed by the <span
class=SpellE>Ramban</span> ( in his first answer) and intimated in the <span
class=SpellE>Rambam's</span> writings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
class=SpellE>Resh</span> <span class=SpellE>Lakish</span> replies to the
heretic's question:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>At scoffers
He scoffs&quot;. The Holy One cautions a person once, twice, thrice, and if still
he does not repent - He locks his heart against penitence in order to repay him
for his sins. And so with evil Pharaoh - since the Holy One had sent punishments
five times and he paid no attention, <b>the Holy One said to him: You stiffened
your neck and hardened your heart - I will add more impurity to your impurity, </b>thus:
&quot;For I have hardened his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The <span
class=SpellE>Midrash</span> noted that the Holy One hardened Pharaoh's heart
only from the sixth plague on. During the first five plagues, Pharaoh hardened
his heart of his own volition, and the punishment for his refusal was the preclusion
of his repentance. The <span class=SpellE>Ramban</span> explains in similar
fashion:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>And they gave
explanations to the question which all ask, if God hardened his heart, what was
his sin? There are two explanations, both true. One - <b>Because Pharaoh, in
his wickedness, did greatly harm <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> for no reason, his sentence
was to be denied paths to <span class=GramE>repentance, …and</span> he was
judged according to his earlier behavior.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><span
class=SpellE>Rambam</span>, whose words in the &quot;Laws of Repentance&quot; repeatedly
emphasize the centrality of free choice as a foundation stone of religious
thought, relates to our question:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'>Many passages
in the Torah and Prophets seem to contradict this principle, and most people
misinterpret them, and some think that the Holy One decides whether one does
wrong or right, and that man does not control his heart to determine his
actions. I now explain a major principle from which you will know the meaning
of all those passages - when an individual or members of a community sin <b>and
the sinner sins consciously and willingly</b>, as we have shown, it is proper
to punish him. <b>And the Holy One knows how to punish - …In which
circumstances is this true? <span class=GramE>When he does not repent.</span> </b>But
if one has repented, repentance is a shield against divine punishment. <b>Just
as one sins consciously and willingly, so can he repent consciously and willingly.
</b>It is possible that one perform a terrible sin or many sins, until he
stands in judgment before the truthful judge and the <b>punishment for these
sins committed willingly and consciously is that he will be denied repentance</b>,
and he is not permitted to repent from his wickedness in order that he die and
perish in his sin <b>which he committed… </b>therefore is it written in the
Torah &quot;<b>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart&quot; because he had sinned
earlier on his own</b> and harmed Israel dwelling in his land, as is written: &quot;Come
let us be shrewd with them&quot; - <b>the sentence was given to prevent him
from repenting</b> until he be punished <b>therefore the Holy One hardened his
heart&quot; </b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Laws of Repentance, 1:1-3 with
omissions)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Woven like a
silken thread from <span class=SpellE>Midrash</span> <span class=SpellE>Rabba</span>
to the <span class=SpellE>Rambam</span> is the principle that Pharaoh chose of
his own free will to exploit the minority dwelling in his land - chose to
damage, chose to murder - and chose not to listen to the cry of the enslaved crying
for freedom and pleading time and again &quot;Let my people go&quot;. The hardening
of his heart which, at this stage, denies him the possibility of <span
class=GramE>repentance,</span> is itself his punishment for his decision to
exploit and abuse the helpless minority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>I should like
to carry <span class=GramE>this a</span> step further, and to argue that the
hardening of the heart is not a punishment externally imposed upon the guilty
by the punisher; it is part and parcel of the human personality. There is a
point where that which began as a decision becomes a habit, and habit, with
time, becomes man's &quot;second nature.&quot; Smoking a cigarette which
eventually becomes a pack of cigarettes, exaggerated eating from which a person
cannot free himself, speech patterns which one has adopted, methods of
reaction, etc. Certainly such is the case regarding all forms of addictions - drugs,
alcohol, and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>As in Barry <span
class=SpellE>Sacharov's</span> song &quot;Slaves&quot;, &quot;…We are all
slaves even / When we have something like this as if / <span class=GramE>We</span>
open our mouth wide / And wait for the next pleasure.&quot; In our media-worshipping
society it is very difficult not to be influenced by social criteria of good
and bad. We are all &quot;addicted to something&quot;, we all find it hard to
free ourselves of habits founded in social perversions. The punishment of hardening
Pharaoh's heart, or, in other words, prevention of repentance (the change) from
his sin is but that second when the person cannot stop. Perhaps he wants to
change, but he has already missed the boat. His body cannot function without
the <span class=GramE>drug,</span> his personality cannot forgo the high which,
with time, becomes his <i>raison <span class=SpellE>d'etre</span></i>. The fix
hardens his heart, and all the promises he made to himself evaporate into
nothingness when he again feels the need. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>How much help
and support does the addict require in order to free himself of the dependence
he has developed? And even then, testify the professionals, not always will he
succeed. There is still hope for the young, but there comes an age when it is
almost impossible to change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Does not all
of Israeli society suffer from the illness of &quot;hardening of the heart&quot;,
i.e., from increasing addictions, even in our protected religious community?
[The misuse of psychoactive material and addiction to them and to similar
behavior, such as addition to gambling, to sex or to eating, also exist among
religious adults and adolescents, even they would seem to be &quot;inoculated&quot;
against these phenomena&quot;, (<span class=SpellE>Returno</span> - Jewish
Rehabilitative Community for Dealing with Addictions, p. 9] at &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Retorno</span>&quot; (In Spanish: U-turn, or return, as a symbol
of returning to life), a village for the rehabilitated, located in the hills of
the Judea lowlands, which deals with male and female youngsters <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>- primarily from religious backgrounds-- who, having
undergone some serious crisis in life, sought solutions in the wrong places. In
the preface to their research volume on the rehab village, the authors (<span
class=SpellE>Ronel</span>, Chen, <st1:place w:st="on">Timor</st1:place>, and
Elisha) analyze <span class=SpellE>Retorno's</span> system of treatment,
comparing it to the well-known 12 step system of Alcoholics Anonymous, laying
special emphasis on the spiritual dimension of treatment in &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Retorno</span>&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify'><b>The
sickness of addiction is characterized by a sense of inner emptiness on the spiritual
level. This emptiness leads to a need for achieving external satisfaction
though drugs. </b>This inner void derives from the addicts' extreme
concentration <b>on 'myself', </b>which is perceived to be the phenomenological
root of the addiction and as an expression of spiritual disturbance… accordingly,
recovery from the addiction is conceived as &quot;a spiritual journey&quot;,
and the twelve steps are the means to spiritual growth <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(Ibid, p. 12)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><b>Do not
these words draw us back to our <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>?</b> Do not
Pharaoh's defiant cry &quot;Who is God that I should obey His all to send off <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>?!&quot;
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 5:2)</span>
and his refusal to see the suffering of those around him: &quot;…for they are
idlers. Therefore do they cry out, saying 'Let us go sacrifice to our <span
class=GramE>god.</span>' Let the work be heavy on the men…!&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 5:8<span
class=GramE>,9</span>) </span>- do these not testify to extreme egotism and
concentration upon the self?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>The book's
authors maintain that the cure for the sense of emptiness from which the addict
suffers is a spiritual journey, the personal search for &quot;the meaning of
life&quot;. The meaning of life &quot;is not the result of psychological-social
factors, but rather the result of a personal decision based upon spiritual
processes&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid.)</span>.</p>

already fallen on the Egyptians, and they were not afraid that they would stone
them. But if that were the case, it would have been on the gate to the
courtyard. But in fact, the blood was only daubed in secret, with the courtyard
gate shut, and they did the slaughtering in the afternoon so no-one would see
since it was close to nightfall, and no one left their house until morning, for
they went on their way and each person closed his/her courtyard gate, because
the Egyptians thought they would return. Only the reason for the blood on the
lintel was to be a ransom for everyone who ate in the house and a sign to the
destroying angel when he saw it, as though it were a label.</p>

a man, for the left arm is weak and is next to the heart, the seat of wisdom,

desire, which is not opposed to the arm, because there lies its main strength,
but where the intelligence resides, there the arm is weak. And when it says
here 'And it shall be for a sign on your arm', it is as though it said it
should be for a sign on your heart, for the heart is the case of the arm's
weakness, for the point of the <span class=SpellE>tefillin</span> is to be a
reminder for a man where the intelligence resides in the brain and the heart.
