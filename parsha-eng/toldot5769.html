that the striking contrast in the grandchildren of Abraham may have been due
not so much to a difference in their temperaments as to mistakes in the way
they were bought up. As long as they were little, no attention was paid to the
slumbering differences in their natures, both had exactly the same teaching and

to the slumbering tendencies of his nature, and out of them be educated to
develop his special characteristics for the one pure human and Jewish life. The
great Jewish task in life is basically simple, one and the same for all, but in

way for some studious, sedate, meditative life is the surest way to court

his article marking the anniversary of the murder of Yitzhak Rabin z&quot;l, my
friend Pinchas Leiser claimed that the assassination was an instance of &quot;</span>the
murder of a Prime Minister by a young Jew in the name of his Jewish
faith.&quot; I wish to come to the defense of the Torah's honor and insist that,
<b>ideologically speaking</b>, there was no special connection between the
despicable murder and the values of Torah and religion. The murder did not
involve considerations of holiness and profanity nor of ritual purity and
impurity. The murder was motivated by nothing more than a <b>particular
political-strategic analysis</b>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>Yigal Amir - in common with a large portion of Israel's citizenry,
including many secularists - was sure that the Oslo process would be
catastrophic for the State of Israel. That is why the leaders of the Left are
correct when they accuse Oslo's opponents of &quot;talking just like Yigal
Amir.&quot; So it is in our country: the Left claims that the policies of the
Right will destroy the state, and the Right responds in kind. Such views are
legitimate; any attempt to silence them will require that Israel stop being a
democratic country. In common with many other worried citizens, the assassin
lost faith in the possibility of averting the expected &quot;catastrophe&quot;
through democratic processes. (Many figures and organizations of the Left have
also lost their faith in the democratic process - that is why they lobby
foreign governments and other external bodies to apply pressure on the Israeli
government.) The problem is that in light of these beliefs, Amir decided to
employ the most morally problematic of means, i.e., murder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>In the period following the assassination, the halakhic concept of <i>din
rodef</i> was frequently mentioned in connection with Amir's motives [the
&quot;law of the pursuer&quot; stipulates that, when no other means are
available to prevent a murder, a bystander is allowed to kill the person
attempting to commit murder]. Perhaps the expression <i>din rodef</i> sounds
exotic to secularists' ears, but anyone with a bit of Torah education knows
that it is a purely rational principle - a principle of natural justice that
would be accepted by any court in any civilized country. The problem was, of
course, that the murderer's application of this universal principle was
invalid, criminal, and destructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>A few words about the &quot;Rabin Legacy.&quot; In the period before the
murder, many citizens believed that &quot;Mr. Security&quot; (i.e., Yitzhak
Rabin) would stop the Oslo process if it became clear that it was endangering
the well-being of the state. It is very difficult to guess how Rabin's views
would have developed if he had remained alive. We do not know if he would have
continued to support Oslo; nor do we know whether he would have supported the &quot;disengagement.&quot;
On such matters, the Torah has commanded us: <i>There shall not be among you...
one who asks questions of the dead</i>. We only know what Yitzhak Rabin said in
his speech to the Knesset on the fifth of October, 1995, a month before his
death. He called for Israeli sovereignty over a united Jerusalem, Ma'alei
Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, Gush Etzion, Beitar, Efrat, and additional settlements. He
called for the establishment of new settlement blocs in Judea and Samaria,
emulating the model of Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. He said that he supported
the establishment of a Palestinian political entity which would be less than a
state. His speech can be read (apparently, only in English translation!) on the
Foreign Ministry website:</p>

besides committing an abhorrent murder, Yigal Amir desecrated the Name of God
and the honor of the Torah in that he was identified by the public as a
religious person. There is certainly no Torah value that justifies murder in
the name of political disagreement. The problem is that the murderer did not
act in a vacuum. Whether or not we assume that Yigal Amir received an explicit
&quot;halakhic ruling&quot; applying <i>din rodef</i> to Yitzhak Rabin
(something claimed by Rabbi Yoel Bin Nun, among others, and for which he
suffered persecution at that time), it is impossible to ignore the atmosphere
that was created in part of the National-Religious community which lent
legitimacy to the murder. It was not without reason that, following the murder,
Rabbi Lichtenstein taught the Talmudic discussion from tractate Yoma mentioned
in my article. It was not without reason that Rabbi Yehudah Amital traced a
direct connection between the massacre in Me'arat haMakhpela and the Rabin
assassination. It is not accidental that both Baruch Goldstein and Yigal Amir
were identified with the ideology of Meir Kahane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

exists within the religious community a group which continues in the path of
Meir Kahane. Unfortunately, this group has not disappeared and it is not so
marginal. It justifies extreme nationalism and racism in the name of the Torah
and it is a phenomenon lying beyond the bounds of legitimate political debate. This
group does not believe in democracy and therefore the matter has no connection
with Rabin's worldview while he was alive, nor with the decisions he might have
made if he had remained alive and in power. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
