<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Chazal
dealt at length with Korach and the story of the controversy he aroused against
Moshe and his leadership in the desert; no wonder, then, that rabbinical
literature paints him in a most unflattering light, and that harsh and
pejorative words were leveled at him, such as the charge that Korach was
envious of Moshe and Aharon, that he sought status of which he was not worthy,
and even brazenly declared &quot;Torah was not given from Heaven, and Moshe is
not a prophet and Aharon is not high priest<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;
(Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin 10:28a). </span>And so severe was their transgression,
that Rabbi Akiva - although not all sages were in accord - categorically
decreed that &quot;Korach's band is not destined to rise up [from Sheol, and
rise up at the resurrection]&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Mishna,
Sanhedrin 10:3) </span>and many similar statements. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><b>Our
Sages portray Korach as - among other things - an exceedingly opulent</b> <b>man.
</b>The term &quot;rich as Korach&quot; is still current today. From whence did
he attain this wealth? In our sources we find two, quite similar, answers.
According to the first: &quot;Yosef hid three treasures in Egypt. One was
revealed to Korach, one to Antoninus son of Asvirus, and one was hidden for the
righteous for the distant future&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Pesahim
119a</span>). The tremendous wealth of Yosef, who gathered &quot;<i>all the
silver found in the land of Egypt and the Land of Canaan&quot; </i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit 47:14) </span>was revealed - and will be
revealed - in three stages, past, present, and future. Part of it came into
Korach's possession (no explanation given as to how), part went to an affluent
Roman contemporary of the Sages, and part lies in wait to serve as reward for
the righteous in the world to come. Here is the description of Korach's wealth
as appears in the Talmud Bavli: &quot;Said Rabbi Levi: A burden of three
hundred white mules was the key to Korach's treasuries&quot; <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Sanhedrin 100a). </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>This</span> is to say that transportation of merely the keys to his
treasuries required three hundred white mules, beasts known for their great and
wild strength. Rabbi Levi continues <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(ibid.) </span>and
determines that the keys were made not of heavy metal, but of pieces of
leather, which are, of course, much lighter. From this we assume that the
number of keys was much greater than we had thought. A different version has
Korach accruing his wealth through his faithful service to Israel's greatest
enemy, Pharaoh; he became his Minister of the Treasury, and therefore &quot;he
held the keys to his treasures in his hand <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bemidbar
Rabba 18:16).</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'><b>Why
did the Sages wish to present Korach as a wealthy man? </b>It is difficult to
discern any Biblical basis for this idea. The Bible records that the earth
opened its mouth in order to swallow Korach and his followers, their homes and &quot;<i>all
Korach's people and all their possessions.&quot;</i> These words are
insufficient to support any determination that he was very wealthy. It seems to
me that the answer to this question must be sought in the Sages' attitude to
conspicuous wealth. Kohellet speaks of &quot;<i>riches hoarded by their owner
to his misfortune&quot;, </i>i.e. wealth which leads to arrogance, pursuit of
glory, and claims to special privilege; this, says Resh Lakish, was &quot;Korach's
wealth&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bavli, Sanhedrin, ibid.). </span>It
is difficult to know whether Chazal, when dealing with Korach, saw before them
a single, identifiable, historical figure, against whom they shot their arrows,
or whether they simply desired to teach their listeners general advice,
suitable for every place, for all times, and for every person. Wealth blinds
its possessor, and leads him to behave improperly and disregard all that is
holy.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>To a
different, but similar, matter. When the Sages wish to bring an example of a
wicked person who ridicules the mitzvot and denies their divine source, they
exploit - among others - the image of Korach. Thus, in Midrash Bemidbar Rabba (<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>18:3) </span>&quot;Korach rose up and made them [the
princes of the assembly] a banquet... the sons of Aharon came to collect their
gifts, the breast and the thigh. They [Korach's party] stood against them,
saying: Who commanded you to take this, was it not Moshe? We give you nothing;
the Omnipresent did not so speak!&quot; The midrash in Tehillim, expounding the
passage &quot;<i>Happy is the man... who... has not joined the company of the
insolent&quot; </i>speaks in yet more scathing terms:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify'>This
refers to Korach, who derided Moshe and Aharon. What did he do? He gathered all
the crowd... and began to ridicule, saying: There is a widow in my
neighborhood, and with her are two orphan girls, and she has a single field.
When she comes to plow, Moshe says &quot;<i>You shall not plow with ox and
donkey together&quot;. </i>She comes to sow, he says to her &quot;<i>You shall
not sow with mixed seeds&quot;. </i>She comes to harvest and make sheaves, he
says to her: Give me the heave offering, the first tithe and the second tithe.
She justified her fate and gave it him. What did the widow then do? She sold
the field, and bought two lambs, in order to make garments from the wool and to
benefit from their offspring. When they gave birth, came Aharon and said, &quot;Give
me the firstborn, for so said The Holy One, Blessed Be He, <i>&quot;Every
firstborn to be born among your male cattle and sheep, you must set aside for
the Lord your God, etc.&quot; </i>She justified her fate and gave him the
newborn. Arrived the time for shearing, and she sheared them. Came Aharon and
said to her: &quot;Give me the first part of the shearing.&quot; She said: &quot;I
have no strength to stand against such a man, I will slaughter them and eat
them.&quot; No soon had she slaughtered them, then Aharon came and said to her:
&quot;Give me the arm and the jaw and stomach [which belong to the priest].&quot;
She said: &quot;Even after I have slaughtered them, I have not been spared from
your hand. I hereby proscribe them from my use!&quot; He said to her: &quot;If
they are proscribed - they belong to me in their entirety, as is written &quot;<i>Everything
that is proscribed in Israel shall be yours. &quot; </i>He took them, leaving
her weeping with her two daughters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>We
have before us an extremely caustic satire on the mitzvoth. According to
Korach, Moshe - of the House of Levi - and Aharon the Priest concocted many
mitzvot in order to make people's lives difficult, and to plunder them by
taking the many gifts designated for the priests and Levites. It appears that
in the days of Chazal, too, there were people who thought the yoke of mitzvoth
too heavy, or that the priests and Levites unlawfully enjoy preferred status;
the Sages, who could not accept such a perverted understanding of the Torah's
laws, chose to express ideas such as these while defining them as nefarious
scorn - and placing them in the mouth of the great heretic, Korach.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>It
seems reasonable to conclude that by emphasizing Korach's wealth and by
presenting his negative attitude towards God's commandments, the Sages make use
of him as an image from the past which serves as a springboard for dealing with
issues of contemporary interest. This is true also of the Sages' determination
that the controversy which Korach aroused is a classic example of controversy &quot;not
for the name of heaven&quot;. Literature of Chazal and their world is replete
with disputes, but these are acceptable only when they are directed towards a
good goal and motives are pure. Not so the controversy of Korach, who was &quot;a
wicked brother&quot; <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bemidbar Rabba 18:14</span>);
his motives stemmed from excessive haughtiness, envy, desire for high office,
and the search for conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt'>Our
Sages had little use for the past, unless it served them in their understanding
of the present and in their preparation of their disciples, listeners, and
readers for the future. When the Sages came to deal with the social dangers
inherent in great wealth, with the obligation to accept the divine source of
the mitzvot - &quot;Torah from Heaven&quot; - and with the ban against
controversy which has no basis or proper goal, they found in the story of
Korach's rebellion a gold mine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>Throughout the generations of Jewish history, there arose disciples of
Moshe and disciples of Korach. The concept of <i>kedusha - &quot;So that you
remember and observe all my commandments and <b>you will be holy </b>unto your
God&quot;<b> - </b></i>is anchored at the basis of Halakhic Judaism. It charges
every individual from Israel and the Israelite nation with the difficult task
and the noble <b>to strive for <i>kedusha - </i></b>to sanctify themselves with
a life of Torah and mitzvoth. But there were also those followed in the
footsteps of Korach - seeing the holiness of Israel as a given <b>essence</b>,
ingrained in the nation of Israel, automatically imbuing it with high religious
status. It must be said that there were great and good people who were caught
up in this Korachite religiosity, which turns Judaism from the service of God
to nationalist chauvinism. One of Korach's disciples, in this sense, was Rabbi
Yehuda Halevi (in the Kuzari - in contrast to the heavenly author of prayers
and <i>selichot</i>, which are the most exalted documents of pure faith); such
were most of the Kabbalists; such was the Maharal of Prague, and such was, in
our time, Harav Kook, whose teachings became a stumbling block for his students
and his students' students. On the other side we find a line of <i>kedusha</i>
which has its base in the end of the Kriyat Shema [&quot;<i>You shall be holy&quot;</i>],
and extends from Moshe son of Amram, by way of Rabeinu Moshe ben Maimon, to the
Gate of Kedusha in the &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; of Rabbi Moshe Hayim

that the proper order is the reverse; but even the servant who accompanies his

[says Moshe], I never even took a donkey to ride upon. Rashi explains according
to a Midrash of Chazal: Even the donkey upon which my wife rode when we
traveled from Midyan to Egypt was not theirs. It should be noted that he could
have made an even more remarkable claim, that even the bread he ate in Egypt
was not taken from the public. [But he does not make any such claim]. From this
we learn that it cannot be rightfully expected of one who constantly engages in
public affairs that he not eat from public funds, for he must set aside some
hour for his sustenance, which results in not attending to public needs; the
public prefers that even that hour be devoted to their needs and that the
leader eat at their expense. Moshe, too, ate at public expense, and only the
donkey on which he brought his wife was his. In fact, the presence of Moshe's
wife and children in Egypt was unnecessary - they returned to Midyan
immediately - but she had asked him to be able to see the glory of the exodus
