the beautiful captive woman. You know their [our Sages] dictum: 'The Torah only
speaks in consideration of concupiscence'. Nevertheless this commandment
includes an exhortation to noble moral qualities, which excellent men must
acquire in a way I shall indicate. For though his concupiscence overcomes him
and restraint is impossible for him, he must obligatorily bring her to a hidden
place; as it says: <i>Home to <span class=SpellE>thine</span> house</i>. And as
[the Sages] have explained, he is not permitted to do her violence during the
war. And he is not allowed sexual intercourse with her for the second time
before her grief has calmed down and her sorrow has been quieted. And she
should not be forbidden to grieve, to be disheveled, and to weep; as the text
says: <i>And she shall bewail her father and her mother, etc</i>. For those who
grieve find solace in weeping and in arousing their sorrow until their bodily
forces are too tired to bear this affection of the soul; just as those who
rejoice find solace in all kinds of play. Therefore the Law has had pity on her
and gave her the possibility to do so until she is weary of weeping and of
grieving. You know that he can have sexual intercourse while she is still a
Gentile. She may also, for thirty days in public, profess her religion, even in
an idolatrous cult, and may not during that period be taken to task because of
a belief. Withal if he does not succeed afterwards to convert her to the
statutes of the Law, she may not be sold or treated as a slave. For the Law
safeguards her inviolability on account of her have exposed herself in sexual
intercourse, even if this has happened through a certain act of disobedience - I
refer to her having then been a Gentile - and says withal: <i>Thou <span
class=SpellE>shalt</span> not make merchandise of her, because thou hast
humbled her. </i>Accordingly it has become clear that this commandment contains
encouragement to a noble moral quality. The reasons for all the commandments
contained in this book have accordingly become clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

21.3pt'>In his novel, &quot;<span class=SpellE>Shirah</span>&quot;, S. Y. Agnon
departs temporarily from the central theme to tell of a garbage collector who
finds a hat in &quot;a <span class=SpellE>Talpiyot</span> garbage bin. Since
the hat was pleasing, he thought that it happened into the garbage by mistake,
for he was not yet acquainted with the <span class=SpellE>Askenazic</span> practice
of throwing things into the garbage even though they have no flaw. He took the
hat and knocked on the door of the hat's owner. The master of the house came
out and asked 'What do you want?' He showed him the hat in his hand and told
the owner of the hat 'I found it in the garbage can, sir, and I am bringing it
to you.' The owner laughed and said to him, 'It's <span class=GramE>yours,</span>
you can wear it on Shabbat and holydays'. Abba (the garbage collector, father
of another character, N.M.M.) looked again at the hat and told the owner, 'May
you merit many <i>mitzvoth'.&quot; <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>With this anecdote, Agnon summarizes the modern attitude towards
objects in a world ruled by a culture of consumerism, demonstrating with simplicity
how one man's garbage is another man's luxury. The story of the hat illustrates
the social gap (the owner of the hat is the owner of the house is the master)
and the ethnic divide. Agnon has the garbage collector utter the blessing &quot;May
you merit many <i>mitzvoth&quot; <span class=GramE>- <span style='font-style:
normal'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>how</span></span></i> ironic,
after all, it is he who has merited the <i>mitzvah</i> - returning a lost item.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The passages on returning lost items in our <span class=SpellE>parasha</span>
reveal a reality unlike ours, one in which every animal and mute object is
impermanent and essential. Their loss is a true blow for their owner, occasionally
even a catastrophe. Even in the reality with which we are acquainted there are
losses and their return is very important - the disappearance of a <span
class=GramE>pet,</span> or an object with historical or sentimental value may
deeply pain their owners. With all this, our most essential objects can be
replaced: credit cards can be cancelled and reordered, keys can be duplicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The rationale of this <i>mitzvah, </i>as stated in the &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Sefer</span> <span class=SpellE>HaChinuch</span>&quot; is simple <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Mitzvah 538): </span>'The reason for this <i>mitzvah</i>
is <span class=GramE>obvious,</span> it benefits all and contributes to orderly
society. For forgetfulness is universal, livestock escapes in all directions,
and if this <i>mitzvah</i> is observed by our nation, animals and implements
everywhere in our holy land will be as if always in the owner's possession.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Return of a loss is a kind of minor <span class=SpellE><i>tikkun</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>olam</span> - </i>repair of society - and it is with good
reason that the Book of <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> stresses the sense of
fraternity as part and parcel of the <i>mitzvah</i> through repeated use of the
word &quot;your brother&quot;, including the situation where &quot;your brother
is not close to you and you do not know who he may be&quot;. In the <i>utopia
minor</i> described by the author of the <span class=SpellE>Sefer</span> <span
class=SpellE>HaChinuch</span>, the loser need not fear, because his animal or
vessel is safely guarded by someone who is as if a brother to him, as if they
were with himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Twice the Torah urges us not to ignore the ox or the sheep &quot;slipping
away&quot; employing a unique verb rarely used in the Bible. The use of the verb
&quot;to ignore&quot; - once in the reflexive mode– leads us, as is usual with
this conjugation, to understand that under discussion is an act which one does
to himself, with himself. This is to say - by ignoring, you are also ignored
[lit. '<span class=GramE>disappear</span>' - K.G.]. In the inability to see the
lost thing, in the failure to take responsibility, there is a diminution of
self. The person makes believe that &quot;he wasn't here', as though he did not
see and did not hear the distress of the other, in the words of <span
class=SpellE>Rashi</span>: &quot;to hide your eyes as though you did not see
it.&quot; In the Biblical reality, the loss of something constitutes distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The text, employing identical wording, continues to the next command: &quot;You
shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox falling on the way and ignore
them. You shall surely raise them up with him&quot;. The continuum of <i>mitzvoth</i>
of returning lost items and assistance to an animal collapsing on the way
appeared earlier in the Book of <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span>, much more
succinctly <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=SpellE>Shemot</span>
23:4-5)</span>: &quot;Should you encounter your enemy's ox or his donkey
straying, you must surely return it to him. Should you see your adversary's
donkey sprawling under its load and would hold back from assisting, you shall
surely assist him.&quot; Comparison of the two sources, dealt with extensively
by sages and commentators, reveals that the commandments in <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span>
deal with the responsibility for animals belonging to the enemy and adversary,
not to the brother, and <span class=SpellE>Chazal</span> expounded that the wording
of the commandment in the Book of <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> is intended
to encompass the lost item of the enemy <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Sifri</span> <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span></span>). The emphasis
on the enemy is liable to lead to the conclusion that at the heart of the
mitzvoth as they appear in <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span> is the desire to
help the animals. People may hate and threaten each other, but why should the
beasts pay the price? We are not to include them in our petty accounts, but are
rather to understand their suffering and help them, to return them to a safe
place where food is found, to lighten their load. Perhaps this (too) is the
reason why the garment is not mentioned in the Book of <span class=SpellE>Shemot</span>.
Its appearance in <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> emphasizes the possibility
that in <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span> the emphasis moves from lightening
the situation of the animal to responding to human distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The verb &quot;to ignore&quot; appears again in Isaiah 58:7: &quot;When
you see the naked, to cloth him, and not to ignore your own skin.&quot; One can
imagine that the same situation is being dealt with, only the point of view has
changed. In <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span>, someone finds a garment, a
covering, and he is required to watch over it until &quot;your brother inquires
for it&quot;. The passage in Isaiah speaks of one who has somehow lost his
garment; the prophet recalls the bond of flesh, paralleling the tie of fraternity.
The <span class=SpellE>unclothed's</span> flesh which is revealed is our flesh,
we may not ignore it. We, in personality and flesh, must be present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>The way lost items are returned has changed beyond recognition since
the Biblical era, but there will always be losses. People lose their source of
livelihood, their home, sometimes their dignity. The power of routine and anesthetization
to seeing distress causes us to ignore, to look aside, <span class=GramE>to</span>
disappear. <span class=SpellE>Chazal</span> formulated the spirit of the <i>mitzvah</i>
in the following simple words: &quot;And you shall return it [lit<span
class=GramE>. '</span>him'] to him&quot; - you shall return himself to him&quot;.<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> (<span class=SpellE>Sifre</span> <span class=SpellE>Devarim</span></span>).
In the spirit of the <i>mitzvah</i> we are enjoined to identify these losses
and these losers, and, regardless of the difficulty, not to ignore them.</p>
