<P ALIGN="CENTER">EVERY MAN HAS A SEA OF "<I>SOF" </I>IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS LIFE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Chayim Rubenstein</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The creation of water is nowhere described &ndash; we read only of its division 'between water and water'. It is as if it were drawn from other worlds, eternal and constant. As if its essence touches upon other forms, upon hidden essences, it's source is life, it is entirely a non-ending process. All the streams run to the sea, but the sea is never full &ndash; its entirety is dynamic, changing form and adapting form, waves come and recede, it is full of life, its depths unknown, in its bosom unseen depths.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Everyone has a Sea of 'Sof' in the middle of his life, a Sea of Finality. Sometimes even twice. One stands on the shore, there is no bridge, no place whole. He turns here and there, but the sea has no end, it is shattered, it strikes, smites and returns. The breaking waves spray their foam upon the rocks, and the color of the sea turns green. How shall he cross this wilderness, forge a path between its waves?</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Everyman has a Sea of 'Sof' in his life; he, too, has the army of Egypt behind him, speeding-galloping. Soon they will smash his back against the waves. There is no exit from the labyrinth, on the edge of the depth and the pit . . . a crushing sensation of no-exit.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>The faith which results in poetry is the key to the exit of the labyrinth. At that point where logic failed, Nachshon leaped into the sea, moving ahead even as the waters reached his nostrils. A second before he choked, the sea split into two, dry land was revealed, and the way to the desert shore was opened. When they climbed onto the safe shore, clothes still dripping water and fear, they began to sing &ndash; "For lo, Moshe would recite a single passage and they would answer in refrain "<I>I will sing to God, for he has triumphed, yes, triumphed; the horse and its charioteer he flung into the sea!"</I> "This teaches us that Israel repeated after Moshe every passage as they recited the Hallel" <FONT SIZE=2>(Sotah, 5:4)</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The redemption of the nation found expression in the song of the redeemed, who thank God and extol his wonders. In its journey through history, Israel is destined to encounter many seas, some more tempestuous, some less. The Song of David, read as the Haftara, is the expression of one of these occasions, and the Song of Devorah, read as Haftara for Parashat Beshalach, bear similarities to the Song of Moshe.</P>
<FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>Rabbi Yossi the Gallilean expounded: When Israel climbed out of the sea, they prepared to sing. How did they do so? An infant on his mother's lap and a baby sucking his mother's breasts &ndash; when they saw the Heavenly Presence, the infant raised his head, and the baby let the nipple slip from his mouth, and they recited "<I>This is my God, and I will glorify Him!",</I> as is written "F<I>rom the mouths of infants and sucklings You have founded strength."</I> Rabbi Meir said, From whence do we know that even fetuses in their mother's womb recited song? It is written "<I>In assemblies bless the Lord". </I>(But are they not incapable of seeing?! Said Rabbi Tanchum, "The abdomen became for them like a window pane and they saw). <FONT SIZE=2>(Sotah 30b)</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Israel's faith was the source of its survival. Israel crossed many oceans thanks to its belief, not to its logic. This day, the seventh day of Pesach, is the day on which we recite <I>Shira </I>- the Song &ndash; the song which applies to all the redemptions, personal and public alike, a day of assembly, a day of pause. Seven days distant from the exodus from Egypt, a week of independence as a people, Moshe stands and sings the song of the redeemed, as an expression of freedom, faith, and gratitude. From this song, every Jew takes the strength to cross seas, knowing that dry land will always be lie ahead, walls of water on the right and the left.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Translator's apology: In the Hebrew printed edition of "Shabbat Shalom," Chayim Rubenstein's feature essay appeared in the form of a majestic poem. The greatness of poetry lies in its ability to include past, present and future. Inasmuch as some of our readers might have found the reading of poetry difficult, "Shabbat Shalom" also offered a somewhat different version in prose.. Since this translator could not possibly do justice to the richness and depth of Chayim's poem, the reader of this English version will have to content himself with the above translation of the prose version. (Another good reason to become fluent in Hebrew!)</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>And we recite "<I>Thank the Lord, for his goodness endures forever." </I>Said Rabbi Yochanan, Why is "<I>for He is good" </I>not included in this praise? Because the Holy One, Blessed Be He, does not rejoice in the fall of the wicked, as Shmuel bar Nachman said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: What is the meaning of "<I>And they did not approach each other all through the night" - </I>the ministering angels desired to chant songs of praise. Said The Holy One, Blessed Be He: <B>My creations are drowning in the sea, and you recite song before me?!</B> Said Yossi bar Hanina: He does not rejoice, but He causes others to rejoice, and this is deduced from the fact that it is written "<I>so he causes (others) to rejoice" </I>and not "he rejoices".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does not rejoice, etc.: </B>This means that joy exists where there is wholeness, and then there is joy, and it was God's will that these be created because He is the cause of everything.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"This Hallel is Read with omissions, etc." -- </B>This is because on the seventh day of Pesach, the Egyptians drowned. Said The Holy One, Blessed Be He, "<B>My creations are drowning in the sea, and you sing songs before me?"</B> And since on the seventh day we do not recite the complete Hallel, so during Chol HaMoed, we do not recite it, lest it seem more important than the last day of the festival.</P>

About us</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was founded in 1975 in order to present an alternative expression of religious Zionism. It is committed to promoting the ideals of tolerance, pluralism, and justice, concepts which have always been centrato Jewish tradition and law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom was established by a group of awho were alarmed by the growing militance which they saw in most of the religious Zionist community. They were aware that religious fundamentalism, gaining hold throughout the region, mounted the greatest threat to possible coexistence, and believed that the only effective counter arguments would also need to stem from religious tradition. They were convinced that the established religious Zionist camp had become distanced from the values which had originally been its cornerstones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom shares a powerful attachment to the land of Israel and nevertheless views peace as a central religious value. It believes that Jews have a religious obligation no less than a national one to support the pursuit of peace. It maintains that Jewish law clearly requires us to create a fair and just society, and that co-existence between Jews and Arabs is not an option but an imperative.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s programs include both educational and protest activities. Seminars, lectures, workshops, conferences and weekend programs on a variety of topics are held for youth, students, educators and families, while protest activities focus on issues of human rights, co-existence between Jews and Arabs, and responses to issues of particular religious relevance. We publish 9,000 copies of a 4 page peace oriented commentary on the weekly Torah reading that is distributed to over 350 synagogues in Israel and is sent overseas via email.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom`s educational forums attract not only religious Israelis, but also secular people who are keen to deepen their Jewish knowledge and to hear an alternative religious standpoint on the subjects of peace and social issues. In many respects, therefore, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom fills the ideological vacuum which has been created and counteracts the stridency which is emerging in the right-wing community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committed to Jewish tradition and law, while supporting peace, equality and co-existence, Oz Veshalom-Netivot Shalom is in a unique position to enter into a dialogue with both the secular left and the religious right.</P>
