Surprisingly, instead of registering amazement at the powerful sight of so many
people assembled together in one place in such an orderly fashion, the blessing
addresses the way God relates to each separate individual living in the camp. Other
blessings that refer to things seen relate directly to physically perceived
phenomena such as lightning, rainbows, and the sea. This blessing, in contrast,
relates to the hidden connection between God and each of the individual human
beings swallowed up in the huge crowd.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>If
we accept the opinion of MaHaRITz Hayyot, we can learn from here that the
blessing refers to a general phenomenon found in every situation in which human
beings are seen crowding together in one place. Nature films that show us
scenes of thousands of birds or animals traveling together as one body are no
less impressive a natural sight than is a large group of people, but no
blessing is required in the former case. The sight of a huge crowd of people
creates an existential crisis in the viewer; his individuality is threatened,
as is his personal connection to God. That is why when someone sees a
tremendous crowd of human beings - and not of any other type of creature - he
must immediately make contact with his God by way of a blessing that expresses
his amazement at the scene before him. He specifically blesses God for being
able to maintain a personal connection with him, a God Who recognizes his face
and personality even while standing in a huge crowd of fellow human beings,
even while the man making the blessing feels he has disappeared into the
masses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>2. Parashat Bamidbar deals
mostly with the censuses carried out among the tribes and the manner of their
encampment in the wilderness. Many explanations have been given for the census
and for the arrangement of the tribes in the camp; there is not enough room
here to mention them all. One of the most interesting approaches can be found
in the book <i>Mei HaShiloah</i> by the Izbetzer Rebbe. In his discourse on the
second verse of the parasha, <i>Count the heads of all the congregation of the
children of Israel</i>, the author of <i>Mei HaShiloah</i> discusses the need
to involve the <i>nesi'im</i> [tribal leaders] in the census. In this
connection, he makes use of the idea behind the blessing <i>hakham harazim</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

matter of counting heads was in accordance with that which we find in the
Gemara: &quot;Their minds are not similar to each other's&quot; (Berakhot 58a).
For the blessed Lord distributed to each his own portion of life and the good,
and not one of them is like his fellow. That is why He said <i>se'u et rosh</i>
[<i>count the heads</i>, literally: <i>raise up the heads</i>]; that each one
should stand on the spot that belongs to him and this will make him special and
<i>menuseh</i> [raised up]... </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>According
to <i>Mei HaShiloah</i>, a &quot;special and <i>menuseh</i>&quot; person is
someone who possesses an independent and unique mind. This uniqueness is
expressed by each person receiving his own private place that is specifically
his own, a place that also serves as a brick in the larger building of the
tribe. The <i>nasi </i>organizes the physical location of each member of his
tribe; in this way he <i>raises up the heads</i> of those in their care,
allowing each of them to express his own uniqueness. Thus, according to the
Izbetzer Rebbe, the point of the census was to allow for personal expression by
each and every Israelite and for them to be able to raise their heads and
project their uniqueness upon their surroundings. Later, the Izbitzer uses a
beautiful parable to explain the connection between the <i>nasi</i> and his
tribe. He compares the tribal members to fruit trees which grow in an orchard
and the <i>nasi</i> to the fruit grower who recognizes each tree by its
location:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grower wanders around his orchard and distinguishes between trees according to
their location and surroundings. Sometimes the manager of a large company or
the principal of a large school knows those in his charge in this way; he
enjoys a bit of &quot;discernment of secrets.&quot; Nonetheless, the principal
does not know his pupils in a deep way, and neither does the manager his
workers. No human being is capable of knowing the faces and minds of hundreds
of thousands of people, relating to each personally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that a person needs his own space, his own &quot;four cubits,&quot; in order to
actualize himself and his unique nature. Large groups of people, such as tribes
and nations need their own territory in order to actualize their cultures and unique
natures. Jealousy and feelings of relative deprivation between groups can give
rise to conflicts. Such conflicts can be solved by some form of consensual
arbitration, such as the arbitration of a <i>nasi</i> or a court of law. Feelings
of envy and anger between tribes and between people more generally can be dealt
with via acceptance of the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. Elsewhere the <i>Mei
HaShiloah</i> relates to the verse, <i>The children of Israel shall encamp each
man by his division with the flag staffs of their fathers' house</i>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tells us that Eliav would not ask, &quot;Why should Bezalel dwell on high while
I travel in the back [of the Israelite camp]?&quot; For this reason it is
written: <i>each man by his division with the flag staffs</i>, that is, in the
place that the blessed Lord wills to be his place to be cognizant of Heaven's

provided each tribe with its own special place from which it could maintain a
connection with Him. Each tribe's particular place allows it to know God in its
own unique way and from its own unique perspective. The tribe of Dan knows God
in a different way than does the tribe of Judah; that is why it requires a
different place to encamp. One tribe's connection with God does not come at the
expense of the others'. For instance, it was impossible to place all of the
tribes to the east of the Tabernacle because that would leave some of them
quite distant from the center of the camp. That is why the tribes were arranged
around a common center - equidistant from the center but lying in different
directions from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

old paratroopers who were born together with the state carry two-thousand years
on their backs.&quot; Although we never met, I was convinced that he was
talking about me. I was a twenty year old paratrooper when, together with the
other soldiers from my company - part of Battalion 71 - I climbed up the
incline to the east of the Old City. Besides the two thousand years mentioned
earlier, I also carried on my back three ammunition cases, each containing 250
M.A.G. machine gun rounds. When we neared the crest of the ridge near Augusta
Victoria I felt more like an overloaded pack-mule than a fleet-footed
paratrooper. I noticed other members of the company overtaking and passing me...
At that moment the thought passed through my mind that the last time an armed
Jewish soldier had climbed this incline had been in the revolt against the
Romans 1900 years earlier. If I fell back behind my comrades I would not
forgive myself even after another 1900 years... I began to run and reclaimed my
place in the front of the line...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with life! Thousands of Israelis stormed the stalls of the Arab merchants and
bought everything they could get their hands on. No linguistic barrier could
stymie the bargaining... it began in a mix of Hebrew, Arabic, and English... the
alleys looked and sounded like a bee hive... I jotted down a line of poetry in
