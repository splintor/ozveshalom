is hardly necessary to point out that these derashot contradict each other and
express antithetical views on the relationship between the individual
Israelites and the system of halakhic decision making. It seems that according
to the Yerushalmi a person is obligated to maintain clear thinking and judge
each matter on its own merits and in light of his own knowledge of Torah and halakhah;
then he must accept the Sages' decision inasmuch as it does not contradict the
axioms of his own knowledge. The Sifri, in contrast, seems to grant the Sages
unlimited authority to make decisions and it forces others to accept those
decisions, even when they contradict other established principles. The Sages
can tell those who disagree with them that right is left and vice-versa, and
even though they are clearly wrong - the others must surrender their common
sense and obey them. True, the Vilna Gaon did bring a slightly different
version of this dictum, which reads: &quot;Even if it seems to you that [that
they are calling] left right and right left, listen to them.&quot; This version
emphasizes the subjective nature of the interpretation made by one who
disagrees with the Sages rather than the objective error made by the Sages
themselves; accordingly, it has been adopted by those who want to moderate the
extreme position expressed by the canonical version (see, for instance, R.
Brukh haLevi Epstein's comments in his <i>Torah Temimah</i> on the verse in
question: &quot;And we have copied the Vilna Gaon's version, which is the
correct formulation.&quot; The Malbim also uses this amended version). However,
the dictum remains rather problematic even after the emendation. It seems the
Sifri is telling us that every absurd and groundless ruling of the Great Court
must be accepted as Torah from Heaven. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

can be understood as referring to critical speech. If that is the way things
stand, we have no choice but to ask a more urgent question: RaMBaN cites the

idly and silently by as &quot;this innocent man&quot; is killed? Who will
restore life to the killed man if it later becomes clear that his death

RaMBaM's claim that the transgression of any rabbinic commandment involves a

clear understanding of rabbinical authority. The Sages are granted this
