entering the land will no longer be a national conglomeration under the direct
supervision of God; they are to be individuals on their own, and in their work
they will have to struggle with nature and with human competition in order to
merit independence. Therefore the Shabbat was to be impressed above all in its <i>shmira</i>
[‘guarding&quot; i.e., observing the negative precepts] aspect, in its 24- hour
sacrifice of ceasing work in acknowledging homage to God. So that those who
henceforth would feel relegated to their own hand and own arm, their own &quot;strength
and power&quot;, should not forget the truth that every ounce of strength and
every grain of power, and all that they might come to think was their own
production, comes from God and belongs to God; the God Who showed them His
strength and His power in the midst of the &quot;might and power&quot; of the
great Egyptian state on the slaves who had been &quot;bereft of all strength
and power&quot;, and it is He Who has given them the strength and power they
now enjoy and call their own, and Who expects them to acknowledge this fact
with the 24-hour Sabbath sacrifice of refraining from work and carrying [from
one domain to another] ... and on the other hand, all the members of this
sphere of man's power are joined to him by the copulative ‘and' in complete
equality with his own personality to place themselves with him at the feet of
God. That is why here &quot;so that your male slave and your slave girl may
rest like you&quot; is stressed as a special visible consequence of the
God-acknowledging festival of Shabbat when Man calls a halt to the exercise of &quot;strength
and powers&quot;.</p>

mentor, Prof. Michael Rosenak, who died on <i>Erev Shavuot</i>. Because of Mike
- as he was called by all those who knew him - and his wife, Geula, may she
live a long and good life, I became an observant Jew. When I was <st1:PersonName

 w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> on the Young Judaea Year
Course. Mike taught us Jewish history and Jewish philosophy. He brought me into
the wonderful world of modern Jewish thought. Mike thus was my teacher, later
my colleague, and, in the end, my friend. The two of us, in the <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>970's, were among the founders of the &quot;Oz v'Shalom&quot;
movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>One of the central issues in the field of modern Jewish thought is the
concept of Jewish chosenness. Within the framework of these few pages, of
course, it is impossible to deal with the topic in a comprehensive way. I will
simply make one general comment and then a few personal ones: in the modern
era, one of the challenges facing Jewish thinkers , and especially those who
were influenced by the European Enlightenment, is the challenge of racism; in
other words, the belief that some peoples are superior to others. Many
philosophers in the modern period have confronted this challenge and tried to
interpret chosenness in different ways. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>I want to argue that Jewish chosenness isn't - God forbid! - because of
some kind of essential superiority. It means that we received the <i>Torah</i>
and that our destiny is to share it with the nations of the world. In this, I
am following Rabbi Dr. Immanuel Jacobowitz, former Chief Rabbi of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>&quot;Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to
art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and

Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society.&quot;<st1:PersonName
w:st="on"><sup><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>1</span></sup></st1:PersonName></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Rabbi Jacobowitz writes that the Jewish people were chosen by God to be
His peculiar people. He interprets that as &quot;pioneers of religion and
morality.&quot; For me, this is going too far; I would have said, &quot;chosen
in order to receive the <i>Torah</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In our blessings and prayers, we connect being chosen with the <i>Torah</i>.
For example, every morning we bless, &quot;Who chose us from among all the
nations and gave us the <i>Torah</i>.&quot; In my view, one of the central
contents of <i>Torah</i> - including of the Ten Commandments - is the <i>Shabbat.
</i>In the Friday night <i>Kiddush</i>, we say: &quot;For You have chosen us
from among all peoples and hallowed us above all nations, and in love and favor
have given us Your holy <i>Shabbat</i>...&quot; Thus it is possible to say that
the Election of Israel, or Jewish chosenness, does not necessarily reflect any
superior traits of the people itself, but rather those gifts we received from
the Holy One - the <i>Torah</i>, and, within it, the <i>Shabbat</i>. As long as
we're talking about this kind of Election, without ascribing any qualities of
superiority to any particular people, it is easier to dismiss the danger of
racism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>But I still have difficulty with the expressions ascribing superiority
to our language. In the evening <i>Kiddush</i> for festivals, we say, &quot;You
have raised us above all languages...&quot; and in the festival <i>Mussaf</i>,
we say, &quot;You have exalted us above all tongues.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>Exactly a century ago there took place, in the history of the <i>Yishuv</i>,
what is called the conflict or war of the languages. In <st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>9<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>3, the students of the <i>Technikum </i>in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Haifa</st1:place></st1:City> - what we call
today the Technion - rebelled against their professors, over the issue of the
language of instruction in that institution. Some of the professors preferred
to teach in German; the students insisted on <i>Ivrit</i>. Very quickly the struggle
spread to the whole organized Jewish community in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As you
know, the Hebrew Language was victorious. We can see in the revival of Hebrew
as an everyday spoken language one of the important achievements of the Zionist
movement.<sup><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>2</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>In <i>Kehillat Yedidya</i>, in Jerusalem, the community to which I
belong (as do many of the writers for &quot;<i>Shabbat Shalom</i>&quot;), we
held this year an all-night study session, a <i>Tikkun Leyl Shavuot</i>, around
the theme, &quot;Hebrew as the Language of Revelation.&quot; It is a
fascinating and complex topic. In our study, we saw a text from the <i>Admor</i>
- the Hassidic master - Naftali of Ropschitz (<st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>760-<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>827.) In his book, &quot;Holy Seed, &quot;he wrote
about the moment of revelation at Sinai: &quot;It could be that the only thing
that was actually heard was the first letter of the first commandment, the <i>Aleph</i>
of <i>Anochi.</i>&quot; <i>Aleph</i> is a silent letter. For mystics,
revelation occurred through silence, or, perhaps, &quot;the still, small voice.&quot;<sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>But I am not a mystic. What I have is language, words, and word-play.
The <i>Torah</i> is in Hebrew. And if we start with <i>B'reshit</i>, there's
nothing quite like Hebrew that distinguishes between <i>bara, </i>the word for &quot;created&quot;
when it's God's doing, and <i>yatzar</i>, when it's ours. There is a connection
between <i>yatzar</i> and <i>yetzer, </i>drive or inclination, <i>amen,</i> &quot;so
be it,&quot; <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">oman</st1:country-region></st1:place>,

bread, and <i>hahmatzat sha'ah</i>, losing the opportunity. <i>Adam</i>, <i>dam
</i>and <i>adamah</i> - man, blood and the earth. <i>Binah, </i>wisdom<i>, </i>is
the ability to distinguish <i>bain l'vain</i>, between different things. The
Midrash doesn't read &quot;Who is like unto You among the mighty, O Lord...&quot;
<i>Mi kamocha ba'elim Hashem</i>,&quot; but rather &quot;<i>Mi kamocha ba'eelmim</i>...&quot;,<sup><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>4</span></sup> Who is like unto You, among
the silent...&quot; for the works of Your hands are suffering on earth, and You
remain silent in the heavens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>We say &quot;And you shall teach them diligently unto your children and
speak of them.&quot;<sup><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>5</span></sup>
The word for &quot;them&quot; is <i>bam</i>. It is made up of two letters, <i>Bet</i>
and <i>Mem</i>. The <i>Bet </i>is the first letter of the Written <i>Torah</i>,
<i>B'reshit bara</i>...&quot;In the beginning, God created...&quot;The Mem is
the first letter of the Oral <i>Torah, Me'ematai korim...&quot;</i>From when do
we recite<i>?&quot; (</i>At the beginning of the <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>B'rachot</i>.)
Both words - &quot;in the beginning&quot; and &quot;from when?&quot; - are
connected with time, because the <i>Torah</i> helps us to spend wisely the
limited time we have in our lives as mortals. If we take the word for truth, <i>emet</i>,
we see that it's composed of three letters, one from the beginning of the
Hebrew alphabet, one from the middle, and one from the end, because truth
involves a comprehensive perspective on reality. There is a common proverb, &quot;A
lie has no legs to stand on.&quot; The three letters of the word for lie, <i>sheker</i>,
are crowded together at the end of the alphabet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>And a word about Purim, which is connected to Shavuot, the festival of
revelation, both through the issue of &quot;the Jews confirmed and took upon
themselves...&quot;<sup><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>6</span></sup>
and through the fact that on both occasions, we read a Scroll named for a woman
(Esther and Ruth.) If we're dealing with Purim, on Purim we dress in costume,
called in Hebrew, <i>mithapsim</i>. The verb to wear a costume is <i>l'hithapes</i>,
in the reflexive form of <i>hitpa'el; </i>in other words, &quot;to search for
yourself:&quot; who you are, who you are not, who you would like to be, who you
really are deep down, and so on. And perhaps <i>l'hapes</i>, to search, is
related to its anagram, <i>lahsof</i>, to reveal?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>And finally: the prophet Isaiah (54:<st1:PersonName w:st="on">1</st1:PersonName>3)
says &quot;And all your children shall be learned of the Lord, and great shall
be the peace of your children.&quot; A well-known <i>Midrash</i> continues, &quot;Don't
read this as <i>banayich,</i> your children, but as <i>bonayich</i>, <b>your
builders</b>.&quot; In 2009, at the Israel Prize ceremony, Professor Mordecai
Rotenberg, speaking on behalf of the laureates, said that children inherit the
past. Their task is to receive the tradition from their parents. But <b>builders
</b>take the tradition and build on it, shaping it for the future. With regard
to the <i>Torah</i>, the Jewish tradition and Hebrew culture - we are both
heirs and builders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'>We could of course keep going and give many more examples. The bottom
line is that there is a deep connection between the Hebrew language, as it has
developed, and the <i>Torah</i> revelation. Perhaps other languages have a
similar potential, I don't know. To the best of my knowledge, other religions,
even when they have sacred scriptures, haven't developed a kind of Midrashic
tradition that de-constructs the holy text, in order to disclose different
possible readings. In Hebrew, this method developed of realizing a wide range
of hermeneutical and homiletical possibilities that are potentially to be found
within the text of the <i>Torah</i>. Thus Hebrew isn't superior to the other
languages; it's different, and the difference is evident in the Midrashic
method. And in this, I believe, lies the uniqueness of Hebrew and of the Jewish
people.</p>

serve Him we succeed, have enough food to satisfy us and live well - then we
shall observe His Torah,&quot; for the point of that
[the&nbsp;Massah&nbsp;episode] was that if the Lord would miraculously supply
them with water, then they would follow Him through the wilderness, but if not
they would leave Him. This was accounted to them as a great sin, for after it
had been demonstrated to them with signs and wonders that Moses was a prophet
of the Lord and the Lord's word was truly in his mouth, it was wrong for them
to make any further trial. Anyone who would do so would not be testing the
prophet - he would be testing the blessed Lord to see if His powers were
sufficient to the task. Therefore, it has been prohibited for all the
generations to test the Torah or the Prophets, for it is wrong to serve the
Lord in a doubting fashion, or based upon demands for miracles and tests. It is
not the Lord's will to perform miracles for all persons and at all times, and
it is wrong to serve Him in order to receive a reward. Rather, one may come

never realized. On this subject, too, Talmudic literature, midrashim, and
aggadot make forceful statements, such as those great consolations which
Yirmiyahu predicts for Efrayim and the ten tribes, and for our mother Rachel
