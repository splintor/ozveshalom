We have no difficulty understanding the sage who said "one within the other" &ndash; it suits the name "Makhpela".  But he who explained "a room and an attic above it" -  why call it Makhpela? (In what sense is it "double?") Because it holds multiple couples.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">"<I>SHE IS GOOD TO HIM, NEVER BAD</I>"</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THIS IS OUR MOTHER RIVKA</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">(Midrash Mishlei 31)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many parshiot are named after individuals; righteous ones and wicked ones, sons of the covenant and those not of the covenant. Thus Noach,Yitro, Korach, Balak, and Pinchas. Our parasha is unique in that it is named after a woman. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The name of the parasha seems tell us nothing about its content. It is derived technically from the parasha's opening sentence. The parasha tells us nothing about Sara's life &ndash; we are told only about events subsequent to her death. Even so, there is a point in asking how the events in the parasha are related to Sara's life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main portion of the parasha, both qualitatively and quantitatively, is the story of the bringing of Rivka to Yitzhak. The objective of the episode and its conclusion are to be found in the verse: "<I>Yitzhak brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, he took Rivka and she became his wife, and he loved her. Thus was he comforted after his mother." </I>(24;67)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The closing subjects of the parasha -- the flourishing family which Avraham raises with Ketura and the birth of Yishmael's twelve tribes &ndash; are acts of restoration and rehabilitation of people who had been hurt. In these parshiot, the names of Avraham's additional wives stand out: Ketura and Hagar, with allusions to other concubines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The men in our parasha &ndash; Yitzhak and Avraham, are vulnerable and imperfect. Following Sara's interment, Avraham attends to finding a match for his son, and he attempts to connect the son with his lost and distant family in Haran.  By this act, Avraham tries to renew the ties with his far away family which he forsake in his youth when he married Sara (but without renouncing the destiny and the dream of Eretz Yisrael). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  this,  Avraham leaves the stage of public and religious activity, and confines himself to his home where, together with Ketura, he applies himself to raising a new family.  He does save the destined ties with the Land for Yitzhak, but it is doubtful that the two met again; Sara's tent, in which Yitzhak lived and to which he returned to live his final years, is located in Kiryat Arba; Avraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Yitzhak, who lived neither in his father's tent nor in his mother's deserted tent, but "<I>in the field", </I> "<I>on the way to</I> "<I> . . . where you come to the Well of the Living-One Who-Sees-Me" </I>(home of his stepmother Hagar), enters the tent only after he has succeeded in perfecting himself by taking a suitable wife. Rivka and the love she arouses in Yitzhak are the means of coping with the mourning and filling the vacuum created  in the beginning of the parasha, (and perhaps even in the preceding parasha, in which  Avraham's two sons  are hurt by what  they might have  considered paternal </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">renunciation).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the death of Sara is indeed the pivotal force moving the events in our parasha;  the filling of  the vacuum by Rivka, Hagar, and Ketura  concludes the parasha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;With this understanding of the parasha, we now proceed to examine the story of Avraham's servant and Rivka, which transpires in Haran. In accordance with the above description, this story is supposed to present Rivka's exceptional qualities, qualities which will enable her to comfort Yitzhak. Among all woman awaiting marriage, Rivka seems to the only one who is subjected to &ndash; and successfully passes - tests which reveal her character. Rivka's personality seems to be that which the Torah depicts as the ideal female personality. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rivka's attributes of lovingkindness, diligence, and persistence are detailed in the parasha. Let us sum them up in the words of Nechama Leibovitz, z"l:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is to inform us that the undertaking involved running to the well not once, nor twice, nor thrice; she kept running back and forth "<I>until they had finished drinking." </I>  As all this took place,  the servant  "<I>kept staring at her, (waiting) silently . . ."  </I>He and all those with him do not lift a finger to help as she works &ndash;unquestioning, patiently, running, indefatigable. Considerations of practicality and profit are non-existent as she gives water to man and beast. These "fools" are the people who have always kept the world going.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In these words, Nechama attacks the current term '<I>freiyer</I>' [Translator's note &ndash; Israeli derogatory term for the goody-goody who always does the right thing].  Rivka's  naivet&#233; and her burning altruism, which seem to make her a target for exploitation, are considered by Nechama (who follows the Malbim here) to be worthy of all praise.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rivka is depicted as one who devotes all her strength and effort to the other, to a total stranger who arrives with ten camels  and does not even bother to introduce  himself.  Later she endangers her life and falls off the camel when she sees "<I>that man"</I>  - Yitzhak.  Still later she will take upon herself the risk of a curse as she navigates Yaakov to his status as the chosen son.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rivka's passing is wrapped in mystery. In contrast to Sara and Rachel, the Torah tells us nothing about her death. The Midrash (Pesikta Rabati 2) fills in:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When she died, she was taken out (for burial) at night; it was done because of him (Esav); this was her will. She said: Yaakov, my righteous son, is not present. Yitzhak, my righteous husband, remains at home because his eyes are dim. If I am taken out (for burial) in daylight, and this wicked one goes before my bier, people will say,  "Woe to the breast which suckled him!" Therefore she commanded to be carried out at night.  Rebi Yosi ben Hannina said, And because she was carried out at night, her death was not recorded.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rivka's devotion, in contrast to current prevalent interpretation, is not a manisfestation of weak character. Rivka continues to be active throughout the narrative, and even when presented by her brother and father with the option of avoiding the immediate departure from home, she decides &ndash; to their surprise &ndash; to go with "<I>this man."</I> With this decision Rivka demonstrates independence and aptitude for decision which are not typical of passive persons. This independence reveals itself later on , when we meet Rivka as one who reads reality with open eyes &ndash; in contrast to her blind husband &ndash; and becomes the only woman in the Bible who dares to openly contradict her husband. Social convention denies her the right to bless her son herself, but she succeeds in bypassing this barrier and expressing her preferences and her iapproach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rivka's unstinting service to the servant of Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov, are an expression of independence and generosity, not of weakness and passivity. But these characteristics, which seem to us to be so complementary, may also seem to be contradictory.  Our Sages described Rivka's personality as one of contrasts, comparing her to the camel: "Just as this camel has signs of both purity and impurity,  so did Rivka  raise  a saint and  a sinner."    The boys jostling  inside Rivka </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">signified, for this midrash, the duality of her nature; the midrash sees this as a negative feature. The birth of Esav, who is considered to be the 'black sheep', a family defect, is the  fault of  Rivka <I>in particular, </I>, not of Yitzhak, who was considered innocent and perfect. The cleansing of Yaakov's sin (deceiving his father) is achieved &ndash; according to the midrash &ndash; at his mother's expense: <I>"And he brought to his mother" &ndash;</I>  coerced, bent, and sobbing."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Why do our Sages relate to Rivka in this way? Why must she alone carry the  heavy burden  of the guilt over bearing  Esav &ndash; the object of the Sages' hate?  Is it because of her foreign origin, or because of her femininity?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Perhaps the time has come, howbeit belatedly, to recognize Rivka's special qualities, qualities which do not split her personality but which harmoniously supplement each other -- to seek a different solution to the questions which the Torah raises   about the rivalry between Israel and his brother Esav &ndash; who is Edom.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is It Permissible to Criticize the Actions of Tsaddikim?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Said Rabi Shmuel bar Nahmani in the name of Rabi Yochanan: Three made improper requests, two were answered properly, and one was answered improperly --  Eliezer servant of Avraham, and Shaul ben Kish, and Yiftach HaGiladi. Eliezer, servant of Avraham, as is written (Bereishit 24) <I>"May it be that the maiden to whom I say: Pray lower your pitcher etc." </I>Even if she were to be crippled, even blind!? Nonetheless, he was answered properly, and Rivka appeared. (Bavli Taanit 4a)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One may not practice divination, as is written "<I>You are not to practice divination." </I> What is divination? For example, those who say,  "Because my bread fell from my mouth or my staff from my hand, I will not go to such and such a place today because if I do go, I will not succeed in my affairs" or "Because a fox passed on my right, I will not leave my house today, for if I go out a scoundrel will harm me". Or those who hear a bird chirp and say: "It will be so and not so", "It will be advantageous to so and bad to do otherwise", and those who say "Slaughter this chicken who crowed at night", "Slaughter this hen who crowed like a rooster", and so one who devises omens for himself, "If such and such will happen to me, I will do so and so, and I will not be harmed", or "I will not do as <B>Eliezer servant of Avraham"</B>, and all similar cases, <B>all this is forbidden, <I> </B></I>and whoever acts in accordance with any of the above, is to be flogged.  <FONT SIZE=2>(Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Idol Worship 11:4) </P>
</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Critique (of above Rambam) by Raavad: </B>"  . . . and so one who devises omens for himself, "If such and such will happen to me . . ."  Said Avraham (Raavad):  This is a great mistake. This is permissible, yea, permissible. It is possible that he (Rambam) was mislead by what he read "Every divination which is not like that of Eliezer and Yehonatan is not considered divination", and he construed this as constituting a  prohibition, but <B>such is not the case.  </B>This is what was meant: One should not depend on this, <B>and how could he attribute this sin to such tsaddikim?!  </B>If they were present, they would have conducted a <I>pulsa d'nura</I> (fiery lashes) against him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ketura: (</B>Bereishit Rabba) This is Hagar, and she was called Ketura because her behavior was pleasant like incense [translator's note &ndash; the word Ketura is related to <I>ketoret &ndash; </I>incense), and she closed her portal and had no intimate relations from the day she left Avraham<FONT SIZE=2>.   (Rashi, Bereishit 25:1)</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;"Avraham married three women, Sara &ndash; daughter of Shem, Ketura &ndash; daughter of Yefet, and Hagar &ndash; daughter of Ham." &#9;(Yalkut Shimoni, Iyov, Chap.8, 904) According to this <I>agada</I>, Avraham's three wives belong to the three races recognized by the Bible, as was destined for Avraham: "<I>As for me, here, my covenant is with you, so that you will become the father of a throng of nations." </I>(Bereishit 17;2). In this way, the midrash chooses to teach us that the significance of father Avraham in human history is universal, and that recognition of God which he  established in the world, and that true faith which Avraham was the first to espouse, relate to &ndash; and are open to &ndash; all the races of humankind. This was accomplished through his three wives, daughters of Shem, Ham, and Yefet.</P>
