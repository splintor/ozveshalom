<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rabbi Yossi HaGalilli said: From where do we learn that on the Passover in Egypt  the prohibition on <I>hametz</I> was in effect for only one day? It is written: <I>"Hametz shall not be eaten" </I>and immediately following:  "<I>This day you are leaving. . ."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was the prohibition of<I> hametz </I>on the Pesach in Egypt in effect for only one day? </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Pesach in Egypt the <I>hametz </I>prohibition lasted only one day. The Sages further taught us that the first Pesach was not considered a Yom Tov (no commandment to rejoice, as on other festival days). In my opinion, the reason for giving &ndash; at that time -- other <I>mitzvot</I> valid for generations to come, is to teach the perfection of His  commandments. In all other nations, a day of victory over enemies is celebrated as a Victory Day.  Such is not the case with Israel; they do not rejoice at the fall their enemies, and they will not joyfully commemorate these events, as is written, "<I>If your enemy falls, do not exult . . .  lest the Lord see it and be displeased, and avert His wrath from him."  </I><B>A person of character does not rejoice in his enemy's fall, </B>because such joy is displeasing in God's eyes, and we are obligated to detest that which is displeasing in God's eyes.  Therefore, on Pesach, we do not commemorate <I>Chag Hamatzot </I>as the occasion of God's punishing Egpt, but in rememberance of the deliverance of the Children of Israel for the Land of Egypt. Israel has no festival or Yom Tov in celebraation of an enemy's downfall.</P>

But the arrangement of the year into months and set-times  -- and the subsequent determination of New Moons and all the festivals &ndash; are given over to the Sanhedrin, who base their decisions upon testimony of witnesses.
