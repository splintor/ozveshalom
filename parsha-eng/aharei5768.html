whether the offender became aware of his transgression, or did not become aware

support a falsehood, though not involving the penalty of excision, are classed

style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>. Like all other Jewish holidays, Passover is
a holiday of remembrance. As a community of memory on Passover we recall the
enslavement in Egypt and the liberation from it: &quot;We were slaves to
Pharaoh in Egypt and the Lord our God took us out from there.&quot; Slavery
seems to us a kind of existence belonging to the very distant past, an
institution of no relevance to our lives. In fact, it continues to exist today
in parts of the third world. It was gradually eradicated in the West only about
two hundred years ago. The end of slavery in the enlightened world was
accompanied by normative changes and by changes in attitudes towards the
institution of slavery. Slavery and its remnants are despised phenomena. The
story of the Exodus from Egypt took a crucial role in the shaping of those new
norms. The normative shift preceded the change in practice. The American
Declaration of Independence opens with the proclamation that all men are
created equal, but the realization of that sentiment came only decades later
and was accompanied by the Civil War. The Universal Declaration of the Rights
of Man is a document signed by all the countries of the world, but many of
them, including western countries, still violate it on a regular basis. Nonetheless,
without a change of norms there is no hope for a change of behavior.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>In
order to change the norm set for us by the Exodus story into reality, we must
go back and consider what slavery actually is. Slavery is not a private matter
between the slave and his master but rather an established social and political
system that encompasses the realms of law, society, economics, and security. These
areas establish the statuses of master and slave while opening a great gap
between them. The work and services supplied by the slave to the master are not
willingly given. The slave lacks his own will; the master's will has replaced
his own. The slave is just another of the master's belongings. He may be sold,
used as collateral, given as a gift, or lent out. Even the slave's body belongs
to his master. The master may physically brand his skin or beat him. The slave
has no rights or family ties of his own. His family ties derive from the
master's authority. The slave lacks all rights. He only bears obligations
towards his master.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Throughout
history, the institution of slavery has been associated with the founding of
empires and their territorial expansion. Slavery did not only occur in
agricultural societies in need of extensive labor power; it appears in
mercantile societies as well. For the latter, the slaves were not human beings
but rather a commodity to be traded. Pirates were not the only ones hunting
slaves; imperialist mechanisms were also involved. They needed slaves in order
to preserve the empire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>What
is Judaism's attitude towards slavery? Halakhically speaking, the Hebrew slave
[<i>eved ivri</i>] was more of a servant than a slave. The Hebrew slave had a
personality, he had rights, and the differences between him and his master were
temporary. In contrast, the difference between the Canaanite slave and his
master were fundamental. The Torah's leading motif involving slavery is the
distinction between Israel's enslavement in Egypt and its service to God; that
is to say, the difference between servitude to humans and servitude to God. The
laws of slavery are not as developed in Judaism as are, for instances, the laws
of torts. This is so because we spent most of our history in exile, and when we
were independent we lacked an empire. However, that does not mean that the
Jewish People never kept slaves or that it remained uninfluenced by cultures
that allowed slavery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>In
his interesting book, <i>HaYahafokh Kushi Oro?</i> [<i>Can the Kushite Change
His Skin?</i>], Avraham Melamed discusses Jewish attitudes towards people of
color. He points out the transformation regarding Canaan and Kush that occurred
from the period of the Sages and into the Middle Ages. In Scripture, Kush and
Canaan are brothers. Canaan is punished with eternal enslavement as punishment
for his father. <span style='display:none;mso-hide:all'>Ham's sin against his
grandfather Noah.</span> Canaan and Kush are also places. Scripture identifies
Canaan with the land that the Israelites had to inherit. Kush, however, was a
faraway place in what is now known as Africa; it had no association with
slavery. In contrast to the biblical view, the Sages and the medieval
commentators thought that people of color - the descendants of Kush - were
naturally disposed to enslavement. The Canaanite slave was identified as a
Kushite. Avraham Melamed believes that this change reflects the world in which
the Sages and medievals lived, a world in which slaves were dark-skinned. Apparently,
Jews were also served by such slaves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>This
brings us to the justifications offered for the institution of slavery. In the
Torah we find the Egyptians justifying the enslavement of the Israelites in
terms of security and demographics. <i>Lest they increase, and a war befall us,
and they join our enemies</i>. An economic motive was certainly added to this
foundation - the desire to exploit the enslaved labor force in building
projects and the expansion of the kingdom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>However,
other justifications for slavery have been offered in the course of history. The
identification of slaves with the dark-skinned peoples is an extreme expression
of another justification of slavery: that the slaves are naturally inferior. The
racist apology for slavery is the extreme form of the notion that it is natural
for the slave to be under his master's control. A slave regime is built upon
the essential distinction between master and slave, which views the slave's
inferiority and the master's mastery as natural and necessary. It should be
emphasized that this is not only a matter of relations between the individual
slave and his individual master, but rather also a mater of collective
relationships. A slave nation was seen as essentially inferior to a nation of
masters. The distinction between slaves and masters usually goes beyond the

Torah forbids Israelites to enslave their brothers; at most they can be used as
servants [=<i>eved ivri</i>]. The Exodus from Egypt, which, as a living memory,
serves as the foundation for religious and communal life and for the Jewish
conception of time, prohibits the enslavement of Jews. Does this mean that Jews
are allowed to enslave members of other nations and become a nation of masters
vis-&agrave;-vis a nation of slaves?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><i>Because of <u>this</u>, the Lord did
[this] for me when I went out of Egypt</i>. There is something for whose sake
the Lord took us out of Egypt. RaMBaN and Ibn Ezra explain that the word <i>this</i>
[<i>zeh</i>] refers to the observance of commandments by which we merited being
taken out of Egypt. We are free to offer an additional interpretation of the
verse, making use of the word <i>zeh</i>'s present meaning: the word <i>zeh</i>
refers to something that is present in the here and now. Today, when slavery is
prohibited by accepted norms and remaining practices that bear similarity to it
(such as forced prostitution) is widely condemned, we can remove the ethnic and
essentialist label that distinguishes between the Canaanite and the Hebrew
slave, and leave only the functional difference [a servant still possessing his
own rights and personality as against a slave]. Since the enlightened world
recognizes the injustice of slavery there is no place left for the institution
of the &quot;Canaanite slave&quot; with all of its ramifications. The Hebrew
slave is also different from what he was in the past; today we speak of a kind
of laborer bearing rights. The term &quot;Hebrew slave&quot; can only refer to
a functional category, i.e., a kind of servant who sells his labor and supplies
services but who does not sell his body or self. Obviously we do not have the
right to set ourselves up as expropriators vis-&agrave;-vis others, taking away
from them their personalities or their bodies.<span style='mso-fareast-language:
