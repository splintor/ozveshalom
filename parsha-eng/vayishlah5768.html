regard to the angel's identity and the reason for his attack upon Jacob. According
to one view, it was the angel Michael, one of the Holy One Blessed be He's
established messengers to human beings and the purpose of the struggle was
actually to encourage Jacob and to demonstrate to him that he had no reason to
fear Esau: &quot;Michael told him: ëIf you could do this to me, when I am one
of the first among {God's] princes, how can you fear Esau?&quot; </span><span

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Whether the angel
came to encourage Jacob or whether he is to be identified with &quot;the Prince
of Esau,&quot; there is no doubt that the struggle with him has an important
narrative function in setting up the great surprise to come when the brothers
finally meet. The wrestling match that lasts until dawn and the serious injury
to Jacob's thigh would seem to foreshadow the coming conflict and to imply that
the peace alluded to by the angel's blessing to Jacob cannot arrive without war
and bloodshed. In this way the story again ratchets up our expectation of an
outbreak of violence, which has already grown in the course of earlier
passages. From the very beginning of parashat <span class=SpellE>Vayishlah</span>
we find Jacob struck with fear and anxiety, planning for conflict. He sends
messengers to placate <span class=GramE>Esau,</span> he prays that God will
save him from his enemies, lest they strike down <i>mother and children alike</i>.
He prepares entire herds of sheep, cattle, camels, and donkeys <i>as a gift
sent to my master, to Esau</i>. He gives his servants strict orders regarding exactly
what they should say to his cruel and terrible brother and how the herds were
to be led.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;direction:ltr;
unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Behold the wonder!
All of this pent-up pressure pops like a harmless soap bubble. Esau manages to
surprise us - and apparently, to surprise Jacob as well. After all of the
expectations of blood-shed described in many verses, and following the struggle
with the angel, which also contributes to our increasing anxiety, there comes a
simple and succinct verse which turns everything on its head: <i>And Esau ran
to him and embraced him and fell upon his neck and kissed him</i> </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(Bereishit 33:4)</span><span

as described in parashat <span class=SpellE>Toldot</span> also sets us up to be
surprised. Of course, it is possible to maintain that Esau is portrayed in <span
class=SpellE>Toldot</span> as an impulsive man who acts upon his momentary
inclinations and is thus capable of demonstrating sudden and ephemeral
affection towards his brother. However, we must not in any event discount the
fact that he had planned to kill Jacob, even if he would have to wait until
after Isaac's death to wreak his vengeance. As a result, his treatment of Jacob
in their encounter was not foreseeable nor to be taken for granted. Esau's
earthiness and coarseness do not lead us to expect him to advance at all
spiritually or psychologically; there is a foundation for the <span
class=SpellE>derasha</span> that derives his name from the word <span
class=SpellE><i>asuy</i></span> [&quot;formed&quot;]: Esau was born covered
with a <i>mantle of hair</i>, like a grown man. He was completely &quot;formed&quot;

able to change?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;direction:ltr;
unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The Torah answers
this question in the affirmative. The important lesson to be learned from the
story of Jacob and Esau's encounter is that one must not rely too heavily on prejudices
- people are liable to change and surprise us. R. Shimon bar <span
class=SpellE>Yohai's</span> famous comment on the verse, <i>and Esau ran to
him, etc.</i> seems to be intended to make precisely that point: &quot;It is a
set law that Esau hates Jacob. However, at that hour his compassion overcame
him and he kissed him whole-heartedly&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The dictum just
quoted above is often brought as evidence of the eternal and inevitable enmity
of Esau and of the nations in general towards Jacob/the Jewish People, so much
so that that it becomes drained of its meaning and is rendered indistinguishable
from the stance of R. Shimon bar <span class=SpellE>Yohai's</span> opponent in
argument, who claimed Esau's kiss to have been insincere </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>(<span class=SpellE>Sifri</span>

matter is that R. Shimon bar <span class=SpellE>Yohai</span> seems to be
teaching us something entirely different, and the dictum simply gives
expression to the surprise felt by any normal reader upon reading the story of
Jacob's encounter with Esau: while prejudice, based upon verses from parashat <span
class=SpellE>Toldot</span>, says that it is Esau's custom to hate Jacob, the
reality described in the story's continuation gives the lie to that prejudice,
since when the brothers actually did meet, Esau honestly and truly kissed
Jacob, since he was overwhelmed by compassion for him. Suddenly, Esau behaves
in an unexpected fashion, and this behavior is sufficient to &quot;overcome the
prejudice, for he did kiss him whole-heartedly,&quot; as the <span
class=SpellE>NeTzIV</span> <span class=SpellE>Mi'Volozhin</span> explains in
his illuminating comments </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:

is &quot;formed&quot; like Esau, a man wicked from the womb, can change for the
better - and not just for a short moment. Of course, the unexpected behavior of
someone who changes suddenly from an enemy to a friend would not necessarily
earn our trust in someone usually thought to pose an existential threat. It is
not easy to become convinced that &quot;there is someone to talk to.&quot; It
is simpler and surer to continue distrust of the enemy and to be careful of
him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Scripture attests
that Jacob did in fact continue to be suspicious of his hot-headed brother who
had one promised to kill him; we see him asking Esau and his men to move ahead
of his own caravan, apparently in order to leave him and his household an
escape route in case of surprise-attack. None of us will condemn him for this
natural distrust, but there are some among the authors of the <span
class=GramE>midrashim</span> who count as a sin Jacob's lack of faith in his
wicked brother, a sin for which Jacob and his household were punished. Even
before Esau fell upon his neck, Jacob should have believed in the possibility
of his brother's repentance, but he did not have any faith in it at all: he hid
his daughter Dinah in a closet because he feared that Esau would see her and
ask to marry her. That is why Dinah eventually suffered the events that befell
her, as Rashi writes on Bereishit 32:23: &quot;Jacob was punished for his, that
he kept her from his brother, for she could have returned him to goodness, and
so she fell into <span class=SpellE>Shekhem's</span> hands.&quot; </span><span

ever worse situation, surrounded by more numerous enemies, as we hear in his
rebuke of his sons Simon and Levi: <i>&quot;You have troubled me, to discredit

he is also coming toward you</i></b>: They [spoke] as if convinced that Esau is
coming only to honor him and protect him on the way. Perhaps this was Esau's
intent, and perhaps they understood from Esau's reply that he had no evil in
his heart or hate towards his brother, and perhaps they also told Jacob all of
the words of peace and fraternity that he had spoken to them. However, Jacob
did not believe all of that because when he heard that Esau was coming to him
with 400 men he became afraid, and Scripture did not want to write at length
about the words spoken by Esau and the messengers since they made no difference
because Jacob did not trust in them. And it appears (as is the opinion of my
student Rabbi Avraham <span class=SpellE>Hai</span> <span class=SpellE>Minchower</span>)
that Esau did not tell the messengers that he wanted to go to Jacob with four
hundred men, rather they understood it from that which they saw and from that
which they heard from his men. Esau was unaware that they thought this and so
he was able to believe that Jacob did not know that he was coming, and that the
herds were being sent to <span class=SpellE>Seir</span> and the people walking
behind the herds did not know him, see verse 17. The word <span class=SpellE><i>ve'gam</i></span>

born fruits, for here he is coming to you.&quot;</p>

that they had acted with the consent of - and in consultation with - her [Dina's]
father; for they stood before him, and he understood that they were speaking
deceitfully - <b>why, then, was he angry?</b> Furthermore, it cannot be that he
wished to marry off his daughter to the Canaanite who defiled her, and if all
the brothers were partners to the deceitful answer - though Simon and Levi
alone perpetrated the act - why did the father cursed the wrath of Simon and
Levi alone?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0pt;vertical-align:
middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The answer is thus: The deceit of all
the brothers lay in their telling them to circumcise all males. They assumed
that all the men of the town would not do so, and even should they obey their
leaders and circumcise themselves, the brothers would arrive on the third day,
when all were in pain, and take back their daughter from the house of <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span>. This was the strategy of the brothers, approved by
their father. But Shimon and Levi <b>sought vengeance, and decimated all the
men of the town... </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0pt;vertical-align:
middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Because the people of <span
class=SpellE>Shekhem</span> were evil, and they considered blood to be no more
important than water, the sons of Jacob wanted to take revenge by the sword of
vengeance, and they killed the king and all the inhabitants of his city, for
they were his servants, obeying his commands, and the covenant of the
circumcision was considered by them to be meaningless, no more than an act of
obsequiousness to their masters. Here Jacob says that they endangered him, as
is written, <i>You have brought trouble upon me, making me odious;</i> later
on, he curses their wrath because they wronged the people of the town who had
said to them in his presence, <i>And we shall dwell with you and be one people </i>and
they might have turned to God; and they reneged on their word, and perhaps they
[the people of <span class=SpellE>Shekhem</span>] would have turned back to God
and they killed them with no justification, for they [the people of <span
