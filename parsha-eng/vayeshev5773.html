sat to eat bread. </b>They did not consider all that had transpired to be a
mishap or obstacle worthy of disrupting their eating schedule. The proper
reaction of <i>taddikim</i> such as themselves should have been like that of
others who had caused misfortune. For example, the behavior of Israel after
they killed the tribe of Benjamin, as is written: &quot;And they sat until
evening before the Lord and raised their voices and wept bitterly and said 'Why,
Lord, God of Israel, did this happen in Israel etc.&quot;, and similarly when
Darius threw Daniel into the lion's pit, as is written 'The king then went to
his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and
his sleep fled from him.&quot; The reason this happened to them is that they considered
Yoseph to be a <i>rodef - </i>a pursuer, one whom it is meritorious to kill

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>From the beginning of Parashat Vayetse through the end of the Book of
Bereishit, dreams fulfill an important - if not decisive - function in the
process that leads from Abraham's departure from Ur Casdim till Yaakov's
emigration to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the beginning of the formation of the Hebrew nation in exile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>The dream speaks not only of itself, as though it were addressed to
some anonymous reader; it appears in a specific context, its content and
meaning linked to the personality of the dreamer and the dreamer's ability to
relate correctly to the dream, in keeping with the time and place it appears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>From this aspect, a comparison of Yaakov's dream during the night of
his flight from his childhood home en route to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Aram</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and the dreams of Joseph who,
together with the sons of the concubines, herds his father's sheep, is highly
instructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'><b>These
dreams have the grandeur of content in common.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>In the first dream, &quot;a ramp set against the ground with its head
reaching the heavens&quot; - the head of the ramp or the head of the ladder? - &quot;messengers
of God were going up and coming down it&quot; - 'it' being the ramp or the
dreamer? The vagueness of the verse serves to enhance the lofty impression. And
as if this were not enough, God is poised at the head of the ramp and promises
the dreamer sweeping guarantees, no less than a divine insurance policy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>Yoseph also dreams, dreams suitable for young man deeply concerned
about his place among the brothers; he is the sheave standing the middle of the
field, and the brothers' sheaves bow to him; he is the star to which the sun
and moon and all the others bow down. In both cases, the dream strokes the ego
of the dreamer, and, as Dr. Freud claimed, it expresses the heart's desires, both
hidden and overt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>The great difference begins with the awakening. Yaakov awakes and says:
&quot;Indeed, the Lord is in this place, and I did not know&quot;. <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>The next passage describes Yaakov's
attitude to his dream: &quot;And he was afraid and he said: &quot;How fearsome
is this place, this cannot be but the house of God, and this is the gate of the
heavens.&quot; The Sefat Emet <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit,
Vayetseh, 5634, s.v. &quot;and Yaakov awoke&quot;) </span>offers a wonderful
explanation of Yaakov's somewhat surprising amazement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.1pt;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:45.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>This was written
in praise of our father Yaakov, of blessed memory, for any other man would have
been prideful, whereas fear and awe fell upon Yaakov. This is a sign that he was
<b>a man of truth.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>Yaakov, who deceived his brother and his father, is termed 'a man of
truth'; &quot;You have given truth to Yaakov&quot;'. But what is &quot;a man of
truth&quot;? The Sefat Emet [&quot;Emet&quot; means &quot;truth&quot;] teaches
us: <b>A man of truth is one who does not deceived himself about himself.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>Yaakov knows that the vision of the ramp with its top reaching the
heavens does not describe his true situation as he flees his brother; he has
yet to prove himself and cope with life's challenges before he can be called <b>Yisrael.
</b>Therefore his dream fills him with awe, not with conceit. The man of truth
cannot take pride in the great dreams which come to him. He is frightened by
the presumptuous aspiration, dangerous to himself and others. Hence, adds the
Sefat Emet:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>As a result of this awe his descendents merited that this location
would be the site of the Temple, as is written &quot;the house of God&quot; and
it appears (<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bereishit Rabba 89, 7) </span>that
He showed it [the Temple] to him both built and destroyed etc., for the
existence of the Temple is dependent upon this awe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>The existence of the Temple is not dependent upon the holiness of the
site nor upon divine pledge; it depends upon man's fear - if he is indeed a man
of truth - of losing &quot;the house of God&quot;; it depends upon the
trepidation of man who is aware of the gap between his heavenward aspirations
and his human situation, between the head resting on the stone and the head
hovering in the heaven of the ideal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>The site of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City>
is in this gap which is called &quot;fear of God&quot; [lit. &quot;fear of
heaven&quot;], fear of the ontological gap that separates imagination from
reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'><b>And now
from Yaakov's dream to Yoseph's dreams<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>The dreamer in Parashat Vayeshev is a youth who informs his father of
his brothers' misconduct. He earns his father's affection and takes pride in
the amazing technicolor coat. He is the one whose brothers - and we well
understand them - &quot;cannot speak to him in peace&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>It is noteworthy that in this story, no one &quot;can&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-.1pt;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:45.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>The father, who
longs for his loving wife, cannot help preferring her son over all the other
brothers; the brothers cannot but despise their preferred and conceited
brother, and Yoseph himself cannot keep from relating his transparent,
hate-inducing dreams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>Each of the above is imprisoned within his inner world, each caged
inside a world picture which he has created from inner conviction and solid
proofs of his righteousness and his adversary's wickedness. In such a
situation, no man can speak to his brothers in peace. Therefore the mission
with which Yoseph is charged, &quot;to see how your brothers fare and how the
flocks fare&quot; [Lit. &quot;see the peace of ...&quot;] is doomed to failure
from the start.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>A long road must be traversed before all can reach their true personalities
as men of truth, able to recognize their situation and the gap between their distorted
perceptions and reality. For each of them, the change will occur when the
initial &quot;cannot&quot;, based on blindness to the truth and misguided
perception due to this self-incarceration, will be replaced by a different kind
of &quot;cannot&quot;, the &quot;ethical inability&quot; to which Emanuel
Levinas refers when he says: I can (physically) murder the other, but I am
unable (ethically unable) to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>We can only allude to the amazing transformation at the end of the
story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>When Yoseph is tested in the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife, he
says to her <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>(39:9): </span>&quot;He is greater in
this house than I, and he has held back nothing from me except you, as you are
his wife&quot; - the grandiose &quot;I&quot; is on the verge of returning - but,
continues the passage: &quot;I cannot do this great evil and give offense to
God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>And at the moment of truth, when Yoseph says to his brothers: &quot;I
am Yoseph, does my father still live?&quot; their reaction is: &quot;His
brothers <b>could not</b> answer him, for they were afraid of him.&quot; And
Yoseph? &quot;And Yoseph could no longer hold himself in check&quot;.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
18.0pt'>That ethical inability - evolving from the demand for truth by the &quot;God-fearing

her&nbsp;take&nbsp;it, lest we be put to shame; behold I sent this kid</i>&nbsp;(<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bereishit&nbsp;38:32). </span>The interpretation of
this is as follows: Before the giving of the Torah sexual intercourse with a
harlot was regarded in the same way as sexual intercourse with one's wife is
regarded after the giving of the Torah. I mean to say that it was a permitted
act that did not by any means arouse repugnance. The payment of hire that was
agreed upon to a harlot was in that time something similar to the payment now
of a wife's dowry when she is divorced, I mean that it was one of the rights of
the woman with regard to which the man had to discharge his obligation... This
is the excellent moral habit that we learn from this story. As for the precept
of justice by which we profit, it is to be found in the word in which he
answers that he is innocent of all violence with regard to the woman, that he
does not go back on his word, and that he does not diminish the price agreed
upon with her:&nbsp;<i>Behold, I sent this kid, and so on.</i>&nbsp;That kid
was indubitably one that among those of its species was possessed of the
highest excellence; therefore in referring to it he employs [the demonstrative
pronoun]&nbsp;<i>this</i>. This is the justice that they had taken over from
Jacob, Isaac and Abraham: namely, that one must not make changes in one's word
or break one's promise; that all obligations must be discharged fully and
integrally... and there is no difference between one who withholds the wages of
a hired man and one who does this to his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'>In the narrative
of Yosef and Potifar's wife who tries to seduce him, he withstands temptation

hardly accidental. Through it, the&nbsp;<i>massora</i>&nbsp;wanted to let us
know that in that situation Yosef conducted a very difficult struggle, an act
involving tremendous spiritual courage, in order to withstand this test of
temptation. Therefore, great is the merit of Yosef, termed by tradition &quot;Yosef
the Righteous&quot;, who emerged victorious from this conflict. His refusal is
not at all a simple matter; it is &quot;<i>he refused</i>&quot; to the tune of
a&nbsp;<i>shalshellet,</i>&nbsp;with its melodic line thrice ascending and
descending, like a warning siren accentuating the merit of the Biblical figure

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'>Said the
philosophers: One who rules over his soul - even though he performs good and
important acts - he does so while inwardly desiring and longing for the
forbidden acts, yet he conquers his desires; his actions contradict his
desires, he does the proper thing. He suffers from the stormy conflict between
his two inclinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'>The righteous
person, however, is one whose actions follow from his desire and his
attributes; he does good - his desire is to do good, and for that he longs. The
philosophers all agree that the righteous man (who is free of the battle
between his inclinations) is a spiritually more perfect man than one who
subdues his inclination. - because the latter's very desire to do evil is a
defective trait of the soul. King Solomon, may he rest in peace, said
similarly: &quot;<i>The desire of the wicked is set upon evil.&quot;&nbsp;</i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Proverbs 21:10).</span> And he spoke of the joy of
the righteous in the good deed, and was saddened by the person who is not
righteous in his actions: &quot;<i>Justice done is a joy to the righteous; to the
evildoers, ruination&quot;&nbsp;</i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid.,
ibid., 15).</span> This which is seen in the words of the prophet [<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">David</st1:PersonName> and Saul] is consonant with the views of the
philosophers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'>But upon
examination of the words of our Sages on this subject, we find the following:
One who desires sin and longs for it [yet does not sin] - he is more important
and perfect than he who has no longing for sin, and suffers none by avoiding
it. Our Sages said: the more important and perfect a person is– the greater
will be his longing for sin, and the more acute his suffering at not satisfying
his desire. They cited sources: &quot;The more a person is greater than his
companion, so is his inclination greater&quot;. They were not satisfied with
this, and they added: The reward given one who conquers his inclination is
proportionate to his pain in ruling over his inclination. They said &quot;In
proportion to the pain - the reward.&quot; Yet more, they encouraged man to
desire sin; Let him not say: By nature I have no desire for this sin - even had
the Torah not forbidden it to me. &quot;Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: Let man
not say: 'I have no desire to eat meat with milk; I have no desire to
wear&nbsp;<i>shaatnez;&nbsp;</i>I have no desire to have an illicit sexual
relationship' - rather let him say: 'I desire, but what can I do? - my Father in
heaven decreed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.1pt;text-align:justify'>Cursory
comparison of the words of the philosophers and of our Sages would seem to
indicate contradiction - but such is not the case. Both are true, and there is
no contradiction at all. The evils of which the philosophers spoke when they
said that one who has no inclination for evil is more important than the one
who has the inclination but conquers it - these are those matters universally
considered to be &quot;evils&quot;: such as bloodshed, theft, plunder,
cheating, damaging someone without just cause, doing bad to one who has
benefited him, disrespecting parents, etc. These are the commandments of which
Chazal said &quot;Even were they not written, they would have worthy of being
written (&quot;<i>mitvot ha'sichliyot',&nbsp;</i>rational commandments).
Without doubt a soul which longs for these evils has a defective soul...But
those matters of which the Sages thought when saying that one who conquers his
inclination is more important - and receives greater reward - are the &quot;<i>torot
shim'iyot&quot;,</i>&nbsp;those prohibitions which, had the Torah not
proscribed, would not at all have been considered bad.</p>
