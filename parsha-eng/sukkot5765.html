direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Unlike Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur, Sukkot
is a holiday which commemorates an element of the national/historical memory. The
Torah points out a clear connection between the principle commandment of the
holiday, for which it is named, and the events which occurred in the wilderness
after the Exodus from Egypt: <i>You shall live in Sukkot seven days; all
citizens in Israel shall live in Sukkot, in order that future generations may
know that I made the Israelite people live in Sukkot when I brought them out of
the land of Egypt, I am the Lord your God</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Vayikra
23:43)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The Torah's interpreters have discussed the
nature of these <i>sukkot</i> ever since the time of the Sages <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva in Sukkah11)</span>. Is
the Torah talking about literal <i>sukkot</i> (booths) built by human beings
(as suggested by Ibn Ezra and others) or is it referring to <i>clouds of glory</i>
(Rashi, RaMBaN, etc.)? The outcome of this controversy is quite significant for
determining the kind of memory we want the holiday to establish and shape. <i>Clouds
of glory</i> emphasize the heavenly aspect of the wilderness experience, the absolute
dependence of humans on God. Man-made Sukkot represents a developmental stage
characterized by added maturity and responsibility, but this kind of national
memory may also lead people to take all the credit for blessings given them by
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>The RaMBaM <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>Guide
of the Perplexed</i> 3:43, all quotes from Pine's translation)</span> explains
the holiday's timing: &quot;<i>When you gather in your labors out of the field</i>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Shemot 23:16)</span>; this refers to the season
of leisure when one rests from necessary labors.&quot; In addition, &quot;It is
possible to live in the sukkah during that season, there being no great heat
nor an uncomfortable rain.&quot; The RaMBaM also relates to the holiday's
educational and psychological facets. He compares the contribution of Sukkot to
the shaping of the religious consciousness with that of Pessah: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-left:42.55pt;text-align:justify;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>Both these festivals, I mean Sukkot and Pessah,
inculcate both an opinion and a moral quality. In the case of Pessah, the
opinion consists in the commemoration of the miracles of Egypt and in the
perpetuation of their memory throughout the periods of time. In the case of
Sukkot, the opinion consists in the perpetuation of the memory of the miracles
of the desert throughout the periods of time. As for the moral quality, it
consists in man's always remembering the days of stress in the days of prosperity,
so that his gratitude to God should become great and so that he should achieve
humility and submission. Accordingly, unleavened bread and bitter herbs must be
eaten on Pessah in commemoration of what happened to us. Similarly, one must
leave the houses and dwell in Sukkot, as is done by the wretched inhabitants of
deserts and wastelands, in order that the fact be commemorated that such was
our fate in ancient times: <i>That I made the children of Israel live in Sukkot,
and so on</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Vayikra 23:43)</span>. From this
we went over to dwell in richly ornamented houses in the best and most fertile
place on earth, thanks to the benefaction of God and His promises to our
fathers, inasmuch as they were perfect people in their opinions and in their
moral character - I mean Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For this too is one of the
pivots of the Law, I mean the belief that every benefit that will be or has
been granted is due to the merits of the Fathers, since they <i>kept the way of
the Lord to do justice and judgment </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Bereishit

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>RaMBaM views the commandments associated with
Pessah and Sukkot as educational devices meant to utilize historical memory,
emotions, and humility in order to help people develop religious consciousness.
The short extract from the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> quoted above relates
to several aspects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>1) Proper timing takes into account a person's situation. In an
agricultural society, at least in the land of Israel, this season is quite
convenient in terms of weather conditions and leisure from crucial farming
chores. In other words: It is possible to demand of someone who is not
emotionally engaged with other pressing matters to meet the requirements of the
holiday. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>2) Man is required to transcend his immediate comfortable existence and
to recall that none of his material accomplishments may be taken for granted. He
&quot;deserves&quot; nothing, and nothing is guaranteed to him. Reminiscence
upon the days of stress may help him develop empathy towards &quot;the wretched
inhabitants of deserts and wastelands,&quot; making him more sensitive to the
sufferings of others.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>3) Consciousness of &quot;the merit of the Patriarchs&quot; connects
here directly with images of the Patriarchs as models of &quot;charity and
justice.&quot; (The NeTziV, in his wonderful introduction to Bereishit, refers
to it as <i>Sefer Ha-Yashar </i>[the &quot;upright&quot; book], following
verses from Joshua and II Samuel, since the Patriarchs were &quot;upright&quot;
- that is, in contrast to other generations in which there were righteous and
saintly people, the Patriarchs dealt honestly with all men.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:21.3pt;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'>It seems to me that this way of looking at
the commandment of the Sukkah sees it as offering a rare opportunity to
develop, by means of the collective memory, a perspective of social sensitivity
and empathy. If we succeed in taking the RaMBaM's words to heart, those moments
in which we feel a &quot;bit&quot; less comfortable and slightly less protected
may bring us to an empathetic appreciation of the suffering that surrounds us, and
which is no longer merely the lot of &quot;the wretched inhabitants of deserts
and wastelands,&quot; for wretchedness and misery exist everywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>The Patriarchs, &quot;Gaurdians of Charity and Justice,&quot; the &quot;Upright,&quot;
who are invited as <i>ushpizin </i>to our <i>Sukkot</i>, and by whose merit we
are here, set before us lofty moral and religious demands. Would that we fulfil
them and insure our existence in a <i>dirat keva</i> [permanent dwelling].</p>

Rabbi Yonatan Chipman's article from <i>Shabbat Shalom</i> for parashat Re'eh)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed'>In his article, Rabbi Chipman develops an absolute contrast and
contradiction between associating the Temple Mount with feelings of national
pride on the one hand, and submission to God, prostration and the halakhic
aaspects of the Temple Mount, which he believes express the neutralization of
egocentricity before the divine infinite.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>To quote his words: &quot;There
are those who speak of the Temple Mount as a national symbol,... There are
those who see ascent to the Temple Mount as a gesture of national pride,... the
gesture of <i>hishtahavayah</i>, of prostration in the Temple precincts, was an
integral part of every visit of an individual to the Temple... It symbolizes
the precise opposite <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>- <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>abnegation of the human self before the
Infinite.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>He continues,
concluding his words with a sentence stating that, &quot;Jerusalem - and
certainly its heart of hearts, the Temple Mount and the site of the altar - cannot
abide, by their very holy nature, subjection to any form of human rule.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>As for the
philosophical issues involved, I could generalize further and say that <i>the
earth is the Lord's and all that it holds</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Tehillim
24:1)</span>. As such, all the earth is His, and it can never be a proper
object of human acquisitiveness... Is this really true? I think Rabbi Chipman
would agree that our knowledge that everything belongs to God does not render
all human acquisitions null and void. In-as-much as these involve human
acquisition in the context of interpersonal and international relations, claims
of ownership can be entirely legitimate and enforceable.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>So it is in the case of
Jerusalem and the Temple: Of course it is the central locus of God's
indwelling, of course everything associated with it points to our abnegation as
mortals standing before Divinity. However, in a different stratum, i.e., the
stratum of inter-human and international relations, the Jewish mandate over the
Land of Israel extends to Jerusalem and to the place of the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>The writer based his
conclusions upon the RaMBaM's beautiful words in <i>Hilkhot Beit Ha-Behira</i>
which, in my humble opinion, have no bearing upon his conclusions. To the
contrary, the RaMBaM in <i>Hilhot Beit Ha-Behira</i> <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(7:17)</span> explicitly states in connection with the ten successive
levels of holiness that, &quot;the inner walled area is yet holier, for
idolaters, and those impure from contact with a corpse, or who had sex with a
menstruant woman are not allowed to enter it.&quot; And even more! The RaMBaM
in the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(3:45)</span>
asks: Why does the Torah never specify the future location of the Temple, but
rather uses the generic phrase, <i>the place the Lord shall choose</i>? He
answers: God wanted to keep the nations from coming to fight over the place and
desiring it - He wanted it to remain empty and anonymous until Israel could
enter the land, conquer it, and build the Temple, placing it under Israelite
jurisdiction. That is to say: Despite all of the symbolism of the laws of the
Temple, the prostration, and the profound holiness of Infinite God, which do
indeed require self-abnegation before God from the individual - at the national
level, the mandate over the organization and management of the Temple remain in
the hands of the Jewish People, as has been demonstrated above both from the
halakhah <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>Hilkhot Beit Ha-Behirah</i>)</span>
and philosophically <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>The Guide of the
Perplexed</i>)</span>. Paradoxically, it ends up that the nationalization of
Jerusalem and the Temple by the Jewish People will lead to Jerusalem's proper
internationalization.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>Only the Jewish People
is universal in its very essence. Only the Jewish People, as possessor of a
God-given mandate (by right, but also by obligation) over the Temple Mount, can
see to the true and universal internationalization of the Presence which
radiates from it. Only the Jewish People can mediate between the abnegation of
the self before God, and its own centrality, as God's People, the Treasured
People, &quot;God's Emissary to the World,&quot; which has been given
responsibility over God's place, the &quot;Divine Embassy&quot; to this world.
The verse <i>for Torah will come forth from Zion</i> will be fulfilled if Torah
comes forth from Zion, from Zionism and from the Jewish State, with its counsel
and control over the management of the Temple's place - only then will God's
word go forth from Jerusalem to all the world in proper fashion quickly and in
our days, Amen.</p>

normal'>Rabbi Yehonatan Chipman replies:</b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>1) It is true that the
laws of the Temple distinguish between Jews and Gentiles, in regard to their
admission to the Temple. The Torah makes exactly analogous distinctions between
men and women, between priests, Levites, and Israelites, and even between the
High Priest (who enters the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur) and his fellow
priests.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>2) <i>The Guide of the
Perplexed</i> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(3:45)</span> offers three reasons
why the Torah conceals the identity of <i>the place that God will choose</i>. Rabbi
Kohen-Or mentions only one of them. The third and &quot;most important&quot;
reason is to keep the tribes from competing with each other over possession of
the territory where the Temple will be built. That implies that the place is
extra-tribal, and unites all of Israel. Possession of the land was achieved
through its distribution to tribes, clans, families, etc., while, in a way, the
Temple Mount was excluded from the regular scheme of possession.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>3) It appears that
Rabbi Kohen-Or tacitly agrees that the Temple Mount is not subject to human
ownership in the usual sense, since he repeatedly uses the term &quot;mandate&quot;
instead of &quot;ownership&quot;: &quot;At the national level, the mandate over
the organization and management of the Temple remain in the hands of the Jewish
People.&quot; I certainly agree with him on this point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>4) It seems to me that
his central message is expressed in the sentence stating that it is precisely &quot;the
nationalization of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Jewish People [that] will
lead to Jerusalem's proper internationalization.&quot; He adds that, &quot;Only
the Jewish People is universal in its very essence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>If only it were so.
However, I see this as a messianic precept: a spiritual characteristic of the
Jewish People that may exist potentially, but certainly not actually, in today's
reality. The people's moral level is no higher than that of other nations, as
is demonstrated by the constant parade of new scandals revealed every day. The
prevalent contempt for the sufferings of others, and policies which trample the
weak, the poor, and the elderly do not strengthen Rabbi Kohen-Or's claim. How
can &quot;universalism&quot; persist together with xenophobia, and with
disregard for the most elementary human rights of the Palestinian people with
live by our side. True, there are not a few murderers among them, but our Sages
said &quot;honor him and suspect him&quot;: we are very good at suspecting, but
not at &quot;honoring.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>The main point of my
article was not directed towards controversy over the status of Jerusalem in
some possible future peace agreement - that also seems to be a messianic issue
for the foreseeable future. My words came mostly to warn against the &quot;liberation
of Jerusalem&quot; becoming a purely national/secular achievement. To my mind,
the leading - almost exclusive - role played by the national-religious
community in these celebrations point to a profound conceptual confusion. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify'>I think that the
important debate between Rabbis Chipman and Kohen-Or regarding the national and
religious status of the Temple Mount constitutes the bone of contention between
those who lend religious significance to Jewish statehood in the Land of Israel
and view the State of Israel as <i>Ikveta de-Mishiha</i> [events leading to the
messianic age], as against those who view the existence of a Jewish State as a
moral, spiritual, and religious challenge for the Jewish People without
attributing religious significance to sovereignty itself. We consider this discussion
to be of great importance; conducted for the sake of heaven, and out of mutual
respect. </p>
