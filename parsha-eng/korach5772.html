that the proper interpretation is that <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> began
to quarrel with Moshe only after the incident of the spies. See <span
class=SpellE>Ramban</span> who writes that at that time all <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> was upset
with Moshe for not having prayed on their behalf. In my humble opinion, the
matter may be understood as follows. At the beginning, they were unable to
protest [Moshe's leadership] even though they felt that that they, too, were
capable and deserving to be leaders of Israel, because they had no proof that
were deserving. They could not be certain if it was the greatness and righteousness
of Moshe which facilitated the signs and wonders which he performed, and they
could not deny that which he had done, or perhaps it was not Moshe's greatness
which granted him his powers but rather the merit of Israel that provided him
with backing, as we find in the <span class=SpellE><i>midrash</i></span> on the
passage &quot;Go down&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span
class=SpellE>Shemot</span> 32;7)</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>
&quot;Go down from your greatness because your people have sinned&quot;, </span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(see <span class=SpellE>Berachot</span> 32a)</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>, and they had no means of determining
whether [Moshe's wonders] were in his own merit or in that of Israel, and
therefore they could not challenge him. But after the spies, who were not saved
though Moshe's merit and he did not pray for them, or perhaps [he did pray but]
his prayers were of no avail, they then concluded that the reason why his
prayers were not effective was that he unassisted was not deserving to pray and
protect great men of Israel - the spies - who had sinned, and then they instigated
quarrel and conflict with Moshe and <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> and said &quot;<span
class=SpellE><i>Rav</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>lachem</span></i>&quot;,
understood by <span class=SpellE>Rashi</span> to mean 'you have taken too much
greatness upon yourselves' - you are so great because the entire assembly is
holy, and the merit of the congregation is your support, so why should you
raise yourselves up over the Lord's assembly? Only the person elected by the
public to be leader and administrator can benefit from the public merit.</span><span

21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>The story of <span
class=SpellE>Korach</span> and his congregation is a typical example of the widespread
difficulty of reading the Bible as it is, without the exegetical baggage which <span
class=SpellE>Chazal</span> and their successors loaded upon it. From childhood
we have been taught that <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> is the villain of the
piece, wicked, hypocritical and cynical. This is the image created by the <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>midrash</i></span></span>; his rebellion is
presented as directed against the Lord and His Torah, and much less as a
personal attack upon Moshe. Thus portrayed, his punishment is totally justified
and proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>In this essay, I propose an
alternative reading of the story, one in which <span class=SpellE>Korach</span>
is not a saint, but he is also not a complete villain; he raises a reasonable argument,
logical and even justified. Moshe, on the other hand, is not a <span
class=SpellE>tallit</span> of royal blue; on the contrary - the Torah expresses
criticism (only alluded to but clear) of Moshe's reaction. In my opinion, the
Torah, between the lines, describes Moshe as one who failed to cope properly in
this situation and acted with unwarranted impulsiveness and aggression. One
gets the impression that we have before us a case in which the Bible is more
daring than its explicators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>A short summary of the story: a
group of notables, led by a member of a very respectable family, challenges the
oligarchic rule of Moshe and <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> and offers a
democratic alternative. The <span class=GramE>reaction is surprising, even</span>
shocking, in its severity; <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> and all his
congregation, including his family and possessions, are swallowed up by the
earth. Two hundred and fifty notables who joined in his demand and offered
incense were consumed by fire which descended from God. What is even more
difficult to understand is that, in this particular case, in contrast to other
occasions, the harsh reaction is an initiative of Moshe who, as a rule, tries to
convince the Holy One to forgo or at least to lessen the severity of
punishment. It is true that here, too, he makes such an attempt, when the Holy
One offers to wipe out the entire congregation and Moshe and <span
class=SpellE>Aharon</span> argue: &quot;God, Lords of the spirits of all flesh,
shall one man sin yet His anger be directed at the entire assembly?&quot; But
only few passages later, when Moshe goes to the camp of <span class=SpellE>Korach</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Dathan</span> and <span class=SpellE>Abiram</span> - who
were neighbors - he proclaims the harsh edict: &quot;If like the death of all
human beings these die, and if the fate of all human beings proves their fate,
it is not the Lord who has sent me. But if a new thing the Lord should create,
and the ground gapes open its mouth and swallows them and all of theirs and they
go down alive to <span class=SpellE>Sheol</span>, you will know that these men
have despised the Lord.&quot; And that is exactly what happens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

foretold the terrible punishment awaiting <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> and
his congregation, or was it the case that he initiated the punishment and
demanded its execution? Scripture seems to indicate that the second possibility
did indeed exist; the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>midrash</i></span></span>
presents it explicitly, carrying it even further. Thus we read in the <span

were, &quot;with His back to the wall&quot;, forcing Him to execute what he
considers to be the proper sanction for the Congregation of <span class=SpellE>Korach</span>.
We ask: What brought Moshe to demand so severe a chastisement? Why, in this
particular case, is Moshe unwilling to forgo his honor and forgive?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>One possible answer is that
previous complaints were situation-based hardships - no water, no meat,
insufficient variety... even in the two most serious incidents, the sin of the
Golden Calf and that of the spies - some justification can be found for the
people's complaints. Their complaints grow out human frailties, and are
directed at &quot;the situation&quot;, not necessarily against the Almighty or
against Moshe. This time the situation is totally different. The complaint of <span
class=SpellE>Korach</span> and his congregation is clearly directed against Moshe
and <span class=SpellE>Aharon</span> personally. This, it seems, is what caused
Moshe to react so severely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>But this is not all. We have
already seen cases in which Moshe's total authority was - either explicitly or
implied - threatened, yet in all those cases it seems that he was never afraid
of decentralization and delegation of authority. So it was when <span
class=SpellE>Yitro</span> suggested that Moshe appoint a judicial system of
leaders of thousand, hundred, fifties, and tens, and Moshe willingly complied. An
even more outstanding example is found in <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span
class=SpellE>Behaalotcha</span>, where Moshe himself asks the Holy One for
people to assist him in leading the people; the Lord answers him and imparts of
His spirit upon the seventy elders. Further on, <span class=SpellE>Eldad</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Medad</span>, not included in the seventy, are also
granted prophecy. <span class=SpellE>Yehoshua</span> fears for Moshe's standing
and suggests &quot;My lord Moshe, restrain them!&quot; Moshe, humble and
generous, answers: &quot;Are you jealous for my sake? Would it that the entire
nation of God be prophets, that God impart of his spirit upon them!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>Even when Miriam and <span
class=SpellE>Aharon</span>, his closest relatives, criticize his behavior,
saying &quot;Is it only to Moshe that God spoke? He spoke also to us!&quot;
Moshe does not express anger. He turns to God and prays that Miriam be cured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>What, then, is happening here?
What shocked Moshe, causing him to deviate from his usual behavior and demand
such a severe punishment for <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> and his
congregation? It seems to me that this very question troubled both the Bible
itself, and, even more so, <span class=SpellE>Chazal</span>. This is probably
the reason that <span class=SpellE>Chazal</span> tried so hard to attribute to <span
class=SpellE>Korach</span> a profusion of negative characteristics and acts
which would justify the punishment. But it will soon become clear that the
Bible takes a different approach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-.35pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
21.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>First of all, it is worthwhile
to examine additional mention of the <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> incident
in the Bible. In <span class=SpellE>Parashat</span> <span class=SpellE>Pinchas</span>,
in the detailing of the descendants of the tribe of <span class=SpellE>Reuven</span>,
the following appears: &quot;And the sons of Elias [were] <span class=SpellE>Nemiel</span>

when they incited against the Lord. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed
them and <span class=SpellE>Korach</span> when the community died, when the
fire consumed two hundred and fifty men and they became a sign. But the sons of

favorably upon Moshe's reaction to <span class=SpellE>Korach's</span>

between the lines, by alluding to the story of Cain and Abel, in which the
party rejected by God kills the party whose offering was accepted. In our <span
class=SpellE><i>parasha</i></span>, we find an opposite picture: Moshe, God's
chosen one, uses his power - perhaps unjustifiably--to kill <span class=SpellE>Korach</span>,
Perhaps the purpose of the story is to demonstrate that no one - not even Moshe
our teacher, the most humble of men - is not immune to impulsive reactions when
his personal honor and status are affected; and if Moshe can stumble in such a
situation, all the more so must each of us be especially careful in such
situations, making certain that our reactions are to the point, not emotional
