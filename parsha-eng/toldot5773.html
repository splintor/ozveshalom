of the Lord through Shem what is happening to her. And it may be believed that
Shem was, indeed, still alive, for he lived 31 years after Avraham, and if he
was Malkizedek, he dwelt in Jerusalem. And why she ignored our father Avraham, who
lived together in the same dwelling, and was a great prophet, instead going to
Jerusalem, to Shem, to inquire of the Lord, for our father Avraham lived until
Yaakov and Esav were 15 years old. The reason it says &quot;She went to inquire
of the Lord&quot; - perhaps Avraham dwelt in a house together with Ketura and
her children.</p>

18.0pt'>Inserted between the birth of the twins and the sale of the birthright,
and the story of the struggle over the blessings, is the story of Yitzchak's
confrontation with Avimelech King of the Philistines to whom Yitzchak had
wandered as a result of drought and famine in the land of Canaan. It seems that
Yitzchak - as did his father before him - wanted to continue on to Egypt, a
land watered by the Nile and not affected by the drought. God, however, appears
to him and orders him not to go down to Egypt but to remain in regions of
Canaan as per His directions. For the present, until further notice, he is to
remain in the area of the Philistines, and God will be with him and will bless
him.<sup>1</sup> It seems that this occurred during the twenty years between
the marriage of Yitzchak to Rivkah and the birth of the twins, and thus Yitzchak
could - as did his father before him - mislead the local inhabitants into
thinking that beautiful Rivkah was his sister, lest the Philistines - whom he suspected
of licentiousness<sup>2</sup> - would do him harm. We are reminded of the two
incidents involving Avraham and Sarah with Pharaoh and Avimelech, although, in
contrast to the past events, Avimelech makes no attempt to harm Yitzchak and
Rivkah. Perhaps this was because of the memory of the earlier difficulties
which he (or his father) and Pharaoh had with Yitzchak's father and his God
who, this time, protected Yitzchak and Rivkah from him, forcing him to respect
them<sup>3</sup>. Perhaps it was the covenant which he (or his father) cut with
Avraham and his seed that protected Yitzchak and Rivkah.<sup>4</sup> In any
case, one day Avimelech observes through their window Yitzchak and Rivkah fondling
each other like a married couple. Even though he realizes that Yitzchak had
lied to him and is furious with him, Avimelech permits Yitzchak to dwell in
Gerar and forbids his subjects from harming Yitzchak and Rivkah. Yitzchak
strikes roots in the land, becoming a wealthy landowner, thereby <b>arousing
the envy and subsequent hatred of the stranger.</b> The Philistines stopped up
the wells which had been dug by Avraham's servants, wells used by Yitzchak to
water his fields and his livestock. Ultimately Avimelech is pressured by his
subjects to violate his covenant with Avraham; he expels Yitzchak, claiming:
&quot;Because you have become far too big for us&quot; <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(26:16). </span>You are too big for us. Yet more, all your gains have
been at our expense, you exploit us and our generosity, it's best that you
leave.<sup>5</sup> Yitzchak's endeavors to remain in the area were
unsuccessful, and two wells that he had dug were filled in. Only in distant Rehoboth
was there no friction regarding the new well. Yitzchak finally settles in Beer Sheva,
outside the Philistine regions. He understands that under the extant physical
conditions, Avimelech and his army are too powerful, and he cuts off contact.
God appears to him at Beer Sheva, reassures him that he need not fear anyone,
and blesses him with the promise of progeny (presaging His taking note of his barren
wife). Yitzchak is thankful; he erects an altar and calls out in the name of the
Lord as did Avraham following his promise to Avimelech <span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>(21:22-34</span>), but whereas Avraham plants a tamarisk and returns to
Gerar without having erected an altar, Yitzchak remains in Beer Sheva. To his
surprise, Avimelech and Pichol, head of his army, decide to conclude a pact
with him, appearing before him accompanied by a royal company.<sup>6</sup> It
would seem that Yitzchak's departure had a negative effect upon the Philistines'
economy and trade, while Yitzchak had prospered without them. Israel-haters
throughout the generations feel the results of their envy and hate in their
pockets, understanding only too late that in expelling Israelites from their
midst, they harm themselves. In a move redolent of sycophancy, Avimelech and
his officials admit: &quot;We have indeed seen that the Lord is with you&quot;
and they hypocritically boast that they never harmed soul or property of
Yitzchak, and therefore Yitzchak should be grateful to them, should conclude a
pact with them, should influence his God not to harm them, and should return
and do business with them. Yitzchak is not interested in quarreling. He hosts a
feast of reconciliation, concludes a pact, and they make vows and he sends them
off in peace. The story concludes with Yitzchak again naming the place Beer
Sheva, in honor of the pact concluded with Avimelech. </p>

appears in conjunction with the Priestly Benediction, meaning that the blessing
of peace for Israel is deficient as long as there is no peace for Esav as well.
Is can be said that in (the parasha of) Toledoth, the gematriya
&quot;Esav=Shalom&quot; comes to restrain Esav, whereas in the Priestly Benediction,
the gematriya &quot;Esav=Shalom&quot; is intended to teach the Jewish people to
what degree it is obligated to peace, and that there will be no peace for
Israel, as long as peace is not established between Yaakov and Esav.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
