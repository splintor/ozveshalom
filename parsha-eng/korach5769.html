HaRIM</i> ztz''l explained the matter of the blossoms and the buds: RaMBaN
z&quot;l wrote that those 250 people were first-borns, that is, that they
complained for having been deposed from holiness and replaced by the Levites. At
first they thought this arrangement would only persist in the wilderness and
would not be permanent, and that the service would return to them when they
arrived at the Land of Israel. That was why when they were condemned to die in
the wilderness; they complained that they had been rejected from the holy
[status] which was given over to the Levites. That is why He demonstrated
[Aaron's election] with a rod that blossomed, sprouted buds, and produced ripe
almonds. This showed that even though the flowers and buds are not fruits and
the almonds are the important thing, that, nevertheless, almonds cannot ripen
without the flower and the bud. Each preserves the other and fruit is produced
from them, so that they are all considered as part of the fruit, for without
them the fruit cannot grow or be sustained. Similarly, even though the Levites
were chosen, in any event they [the firstborn] were not rejected from holiness,
because the Levites' holiness derived from them just as the fruit [develops
from the flowers and buds] and they all are holy. For without Israel, the
Levites have no holiness, and their high station is only thanks to Israel, and
they are all one and a vessel for holiness.</span></p>

controversy of Korah and his faction vs. Moses and Aaron was a dispute over the
distribution of appointments and perks among members of the reigning tribe - the
Levites. Korah and his followers accused Moses of nepotism, while Moses claimed
that he did not personally decide who would lead or function as High Priest;
these were God's choices. </span></p>

text-align:justify;text-indent:21.0pt;line-height:normal;vertical-align:middle;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Korah and his
faction were not the only ones to suspect that familial and personal interests
led Moses and Aaron to set themselves up as leaders. Another great event occurs
the day after the earth swallowed up Korah and fire burned the 250 members of
his faction who offered incense. Now it is as if nothing had happened the day
before, as if the crowd that gathered around to see the contest between the two
Levite leaders - Moses and Korah - had not fled in terror <i>for they said:
&quot;Lest the earth swallow us up.&quot;</i> <i>And the entire Israelite
community complained</i> - not one faction of the reigning tribe, but rather
the entire community accused Moses and Aaron: <i>You have caused the people of
the Lord to die</i>. Your considerations were personal; you wanted to protect
your status. God did not appoint you, rather, you appointed yourselves and
killed those who exposed you. God's response was harsh. This time He did not
kill a few hundred, as He had done to Korah and his faction; rather, He kills
14,700 Israelites. Moses and Aaron were the ones who ended the killing. Defying
the accusation made against them by the people, Moses and Aaron saved the lives
of their accusers. Even this deed did not suffice to calm the protests and
doubts regarding their election. An extra test was required, the test of the
flowering staff: <i>The man whom I choose - his staff will flower</i>. The
previous proofs involved punishments and intimidation. They brought death and
did not help quite the protests. The test of the staffs was, instead, a test of
flowering and flourishing; it had life, it was positive rather than negative. <i>And
behold, Aaron's staff for the house of Levi had blossomed! It gave forth
blossoms, sprouted buds, and produced ripe almonds.</i></span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Did this test
help? <i>And Moses took out all the staffs from before the Lord to all the
Israelites and they saw and each man took his staff. </i>Were the Israelites
then completely reconciled to the choice? Did they gnash their teeth? Did they
apathetically shrug their shoulders? It is not clear. First of all, it can be
seen that the choice has positive significance involving flourishing, and not
only rejection and alienation. Secondly, the question of choice and preference
is not a marginal issue, a quarrel among members of the ruling elite. Rather,
it is one of Scripture's central themes, and the Korah incident is one of its
instances. The issue of “choseness” appears early in Bereishit with the story
of how Abel's offering was preferred to that of Cain, who gave a murderous
response. Throughout the book of Bereishit we find recurrent conflicts between
the chosen and the rejected son; beginning with the book of Shemot and
continuing through Chronicles this becomes the struggle between the <i>chosen</i>
people and other <i>rejected</i> peoples.</span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Every choice
creates a hierarchy, and as parashat Korah demonstrates, rankings and
preferences inspire dissent on the part of those who feel deprived. The
justification of choice and preference is not a simple matter. Of course, it
bothers those who are not chosen. They want to know why they lost out. Often,
they also want to replace whoever was chosen. The rejected are not the only
troubled ones; the chosen also ask why they were chosen and why they must bear
the burden of election. Across the generations, Jewish thinkers have offered
various answers to these questions. R. Saadia Gaon and RaMBaM said that the
election of the Jewish People was founded upon the Torah and observance of the
commandments. R. Yehudah HaLevi and schools of thought within kabbalah and
Hassidism thought that the choice of Israel was founded upon the people's
ethno-biological makeup and the laws of the cosmos. </span></p>

text-align:justify;text-indent:21.0pt;line-height:normal;vertical-align:middle;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Modernization,
secularization, and emancipation reduced the distance between Israel and the
nations, making the question of election more problematic. The solution
formulated on the basis of classic Jewish thought saw choseness as a kind of
educational mission. Election was not meant to grant the chosen people
existential preference or to mark the inferiority of other peoples or to
discredit them. Rather, the People Israel was chosen in order to light the way
for other nations and to help them change. Being chosen means having to share
what you have with others and not to close yourself off, entrenched in
superiority. This view can be regarded as apologetics - but that need not be
so. This &quot;civilizing&quot; approach was typical of the white Europeans'
feeling of superiority vis-&agrave;-vis the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the
Americas. It was also utilized to resolve the theological issue of Israel's
relations with the nations. However, since the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, decolonization, democratization, and the values of egalitarianism and
liberalism have rendered the &quot;civilizing&quot; thesis unconvincing for all
those who see themselves as belonging to modern and postmodern Western culture.
This approach ameliorates the gap between Israel and the nations, but it does
not erase it. In contrast, humane, liberal, and universal values require that
we view all human beings as fundamentally equal. The information revolution and
globalization have deepened the need for a new justification of election. The
information and communications revolution call to our attention the fact that we
are not essentially different from other people. Together with globalization
they reduce the distances between different cultures and pull down barriers.</span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Rabbi Jonathan
Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, makes a bold intellectual effort
to make religious principles relevant to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. He does
not think globalization and our knowledge of other cultures subvert our traditional
world; rather he greets them as a challenge. In order to successfully grapple
with this challenge he says we must replace our paradigm instead of taking it
on armed with yesterday's concepts. He claims that today's religious challenge
is to recognize the image of God even in those who do not resemble us. &quot;There
are times when God meets us in the face of a stranger&quot; who is not Jewish. The
foundational idea of monotheism &quot;is not what it has traditionally been
taken to be: one God, therefore one faith, one truth, one way. To the contrary,
it is that <i>unity creates diversity</i>.&quot; That, he writes, is the
opposite of tribalism. The principle advocated by Rabbi Sacks has many
theological consequences, including some related to the question of election. The
Jewish People was not chosen because it had something that others did not. The
notion of choseness must be understood as a kind of pioneering; to be the first
people to present the view that one God reveals Himself through difference and
is worshipped in different ways. One might say that God did not choose us <i>from</i>
all the nations, but rather <i>with</i> all the nations. </span></p>

direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>These two
passages present us with the concept of <i>kedusha - </i>of holiness - in its
two contradictory forms: the category of, <b><i>All of them are holy, </i></b>which
is the inferior form of the religious category, as against <b><i>And you shall
be holy, </i></b>which is the absolute and extreme opposite of Korah's version.
It is a demand, in the sense of <i>And you shall be for me a kingdom of priests
and a holy nation. </i>The results of Korah's conception are arrogance, pride,
boasting, and sanction to cast off obligations. According to this approach, the
very fact that one is part of the Israelite nation is sufficient to determine
one's standing and value. The Oral Law, however, makes great efforts to order
man's life within a framework of Torah and commandments, attempting to realize
the important dictate of <i>You shall observe all of my commandments and you
shall be holy unto your God. </i>This is to be accomplished by the imposition
of very strict restrictions and obligations upon man, something which has
continued throughout the history of the Jewish People. While the <i>kedusha</i>
at the conclusion of Parashat Shelah is the highest expression of the purpose
of faith, that of Parashat Korah is the preeminent symbol of man's rebellion
against faith in God. The distance between these two approaches, is also the
distance between the belief in God and idolatry. There is no simpler, easier, cheaper,
and more contemptible form of religious faith than the belief that holiness is
a given in natural reality.</span></p>

and known before You that the spirit of the masses are easily inflamed by
dazzling claims, and a person such as Korah, who is spiritually superior and
who enjoys full confidence heretofore unblemished, is able to dupe the people
and lead them to sin. When the masses sin, the guilt can usually be attributed
to a few instigators of high standing. When human beings intervene against the
transgression, <b>as a rule it is the incited masses - who are less guilty -
who are hurt; the inciters themselves usually go unpunished</b>. But You are <i>God,
God of the spirits of all flesh</i>, because You are all powerful God, You have
it in your power to punish whoever is guilty; and since You are <i>God of the
spirits of all flesh, </i>You can discern in <b>your wisdom</b> the degree of
every man's guilt. <b><i>When one man sins</i></b><i> </i>- Korah alone was
guilty, whereas the incited masses are deserving of Your graces. We have noted
a number of times in similar cases: when the Holy One, Blessed Be He, leads
Moses to prayer, He arouses in his heart the understanding of His ways of governance;
He elevates his spirit, as it were, to think - along with Him - the thoughts of
divine governance.</span></p>

plain reading, custom was that the public ruler would be carried on a horse, as
per <span class=spelle>Kohellet</span> <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(10:7)</span>:
<i>I have seen slaves on horseback, and nobles walking... </i>From here we see
that the proper order is the reverse; but even the servant who accompanies his
master on his travels is given a donkey. Not only did I never take one's horse
[says Moses]<span class=grame>,</span> I never even took a donkey to ride upon.
<span class=spelle>Rashi</span> explains this according to a <span
class=spelle>Midrash</span> of the Sages: even the donkey upon which my wife
rode when we traveled from <span class=spelle>Midyan</span> to Egypt was not
theirs. It should be noted that he could have made an even more remarkable
claim: that even the bread he ate in Egypt was not taken from the public. [But
he does not make any such claim]. From this we learn that it cannot be
rightfully expected of one who constantly engages in public affairs that he not
eat from public funds, for then he would have to set aside some hour to make
his living, which would result in his not attending to public needs. The public
prefers that even that hour be devoted to their needs and that the leader eat
at their expense. Moses, too, ate at public expense, and only the donkey on
which he brought his wife was his. In fact, the presence of Moses' wife and
children in Egypt was unnecessary - they returned to <span class=spelle>Midyan</span>
immediately - but she had asked him that she be able to see the glory of the
Exodus from Egypt <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<span class=spelle><i>Mekhilta</i></span><i>
