us that not only the actual criminal deed, but already the criminal thought,
yea simply the longing for that which is forbidden, the breeding place of all
sinful thoughts and acts, brought by God before His judgment-seat; and that

that even though the continent man performs virtuous actions, he does good
things while craving and strongly desiring to perform bad actions. He struggles
against his craving and opposes by his action what his [appetitive] power, his
desire, and the state of his soul arouse him to do; he does good things while
being troubled at doing them. The virtuous man, however, follows in his action
what his desire and the state of his soul arouse him to do, and he does good
things while craving and strongly desiring them. There is agreement among the

continent man...</p>

the speech of the Sages about this matter, we found that according to them,
someone who craves and strongly desires transgressions is more virtuous and
perfect than someone who does not crave them and suffers no pain in abstaining
from them. They even said that the more important and perfect a person is - the
greater will be his longing for sin, and the more acute his suffering at not
satisfying his desire. They cited sources: &quot;Whoever is greater than his
friend has a greater [evil] impulse than he...&quot; If the external meaning of
these two accounts [i.e., by the philosophers and the Jewish Sages] is
understood superficially, the two views contradict one another. However, that
is not the case; rather, both of them are true, and there is no conflict
between them at all. For the bad things to which the philosophers
referred...these are the things that are generally accepted by people as bad,
such as murder, theft, robbery, fraud, harming an innocent man, repaying a
benefactor with evil, degrading parents, and things like these... There is no
doubt that the soul which craves and strongly desires any of them is defective
and that the virtuous soul neither longs for any of these bad things at all nor
suffers pain from the prohibition against them.</p>

that the continent man is more virtuous and his reward is greater, they had in
mind the traditional laws. This is correct because if it were not for the Law,
they would not be bad at all. Therefore they said that a man needs to let his
soul remain attracted to them and not place any obstacle before them other than
the Law.</p>

color:windowtext'>Both in their interpersonal relations and in their relations
with God, human beings operate in the space encompassed on the one side by the
desire to connect with the other, to draw near and take hold of him, and on the
other side by the desire to distance oneself from the other, to disconnect from
him and to leave him. On the one hand, there is the yearning for spiritual and
physical connection, while on the other hand there is the fear of being
swallowed up by the other and apprehension over the risk of losing oneself. Sometimes
intimacy and desire grow together, but at other times the fear of loss of self
causes desire for the other or for God to weaken with increasing intimacy. A
verse from our parasha explicitly states: </span><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:

cleave... are alive, all of you, this day</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:

the cleaving [Hebrew: <i>hidabkut</i>] remains unclear. <i>Hidabkut</i> can
refer to physical cleaving, but it can also refer to a more abstract
connection, such as that expressed by the expression, &quot;to hold fast
to.&quot; It is then not surprising that Rabbi Elazar ben Padat asked in
connection to the <i>amei ha'aretz</i> [ignorant laypeople]: &quot;But is it
possible to cleave to the Divine Presence? It is written, <i>for the Lord your
God is a consuming fire</i>! Rather, anyone who marries off his daughter to a Torah
scholar, or engages in business on the behalf of scholars, or benefits scholars
with his wealth, Scripture accounts it to him as if he had cleaved to the
Divine presence&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

way of connection with Torah scholars, who represent the Divine Presence on
earth. While the verse speaks literally of a natural connection with God in the
form of cleaving, for Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat (who was reputed to have
personally experienced several revelations of God) it is clear that the
ignorant laypeople cannot draw near to God, just as they cannot draw near to
fire. The story of the &quot;Four who entered the orchard&quot; offers a

18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>This passage is part of what researchers call
<i>Hakovetz Hamisti </i>[&quot;The Mystical Collection&quot;] which comprises the
first seven <i>halakhot</i> of the second chapter of <i>Tosefta Hagigah</i>,
which deal with ways of discussing <i>Ma'asaeh Merkavah</i> [&quot;The Work of
the Chariot&quot;]. The various interpretations of the &quot;four who entered
the orchard&quot; concentrate on determining the nature of the
&quot;orchard&quot; - is it a kind of mystical experience, or examination of
questions regarding justice, reward, and punishment in the world? I would like
to deal with two problems arising from the literary editing of the passage. First
of all, the passage tells a story of increasing danger facing each new scholar
who enters the orchard. True, the verb <i>lehatzitz </i>[&quot;to peek&quot;]
is used in connection to each of the three sages, but the formulation used in
the <i>baraita</i> implies that Ben Zoma's &quot;peeking&quot; was not of the
same kind as that of Ben Azzai. Elisha ben Avuya is described as having
&quot;cut down the shoots&quot; of the orchard, that is to say, he is
explicitly described as having physically entered the orchard and cutting its
shoots. Finally, the braita explicitly mentions R. Akiva's further physical
advance; he entered (or ascended) but also exited (or descended) the orchard. It
is very difficult to understand the braita's editing unless we accept that it
tells a story of increasing physical advances into the orchard (Ben Azzai's
peeking, Ben Zoma's deeper penetration, Elisha ben Avuyah's cutting down of
shoots, and R. Akiva's entrance and exit). Furthermore, according to the story,
the further one advances in entering the orchard, the greater danger one faces.
This danger is not physical, but rather spiritual. The physical danger
described by the story steadily decreases while the spiritual danger grows: Ben
Azzai peeked and died; Ben Zoma, who, according to the braita's development
penetrated further into the orchard than did his predecessor, was physically
injured but did not die. Elisha ben Avuyah actually entered into the orchard
and was not physically harmed, but it is clear that something destructive happened
to his character, while R. Akiva, who spent the most time being physically
present inside the orchard - having both entered and exited it - was not hurt
physically or spiritually. In other words, this braita treats the topic of <i>hidabkut</i>,
since its layout follows the logic of drawing near and its accompanying
dangers. The braita describes entrance into the <i>consuming fire</i> and
drawing near to a danger zone associated with Divinity. The braita also gives
an explicit answer to the question how R. Akiva managed to enter safely despite
the fact that his physical entrance (i.e., his drawing near) was of the highest
order. Each of the sages listed is, by way of a cited verse, associated with a
different book of the Jewish canon. Ben Azzai's book is Psalms. This suggests
that worshipping God with the attitude of a slave towards his master is the
least dangerous option and puts one at the greatest distance from the Divinity.
Ben Zoma is associated with Proverbs. According to the story's inner logic, his
&quot;peeking&quot; alludes to a deeper entry into the orchard. Proverbs is a
book of practical wisdom expressing a conservative world view that emphasizes
divine reward and punishment and teaches an optimistic view of the universe. The
braita is telling us that the very pursuit of practical wisdom increases danger
while it also constitutes a state of greater closeness to God. Elisha ben
Avuyah is connected with Kohelet. Kohelet has the structural features of a book
of practical wisdom (short verses, for instance) but it is really a book of
philosophical wisdom that casts deep doubts upon God's justice and His ways in
the world. The editor of the braita marks Kohelet as a dangerous book (that
leads to &quot;cutting down the shoots&quot;), but in the context of the braita
it also symbolizes very great closeness to God. R. Akiva offers the optimal
model. He ascended safely and descended safely, and he is associated with the
Song of Songs. According to the braita, the man-woman relationship is, then,
the correct formula for human-divine relations. The relationship described in
the Song of Songs is an especially worthy model. While it does have a physical
aspect (<i>His left hand beneath my head, he embraces with his right</i>),
cleaving and connection are not the leading motifs; the feelings of mystery, of
desire and missed opportunity are the book's signature themes. The braita
connects its lesson regarding the formation of one's relationship with God and
the correct distance to be maintained from Him with advice regarding which
texts should be studied from the Jewish canon. In terms of its literary format,
the orchard of the braita includes at once both mystical experience and
philosophical speculation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt;
vertical-align:middle;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The insight that the braita treats the issue
of the correct distance one should keep from God helps us to understand the
composition of the entire second chapter of Tosefta Hagigah. The remainder of
the chapter following <i>Hakovetz Hamisti</i> is chiefly devoted to one topic -
the origins of disagreements in Jewish law. In this context we find halakhah 9,
stating that &quot;At first there were no disagreements in Israel,&quot; which
sees such disagreements as stemming from a break in the chain of the legal
tradition. In the same vein, the chapter deals with the first disagreement to
arise among the <i>zugot</i> [early pairs of rabbinic leaders] on the question
of whether one is allowed to lay one hands on the head of the animal offered as
a festival sacrifice [<i>korban hagigah</i>]. The immediate context is, of
course the laws of the festival sacrifices which are also connected to the <i>korban
hagigah</i>. There is, however, a deeper connection - if sages transmit God's
word from one generation to the next, the very development of disagreements is
symptomatic of their living at an increasing distance from God. The disagreement
regarding the laying of hands on the sacrifice is an embodiment of this matter
- Beit Shammai prohibits it because it constitutes using an animal on a
festival day (the prohibition of <i>shevut</i>) and therefore it should be
performed on the eve of the festival. Beit Shammai views the laying of hands as
involving a total transfer of identity from the one who places his hands on the
animal to the animal itself (and so to in regards to semicha - the symbolic transfer
of rabbinic authority from teacher to student via the laying of hands). Beit
Hillel permits the laying of hands on a festival day not only because of
systematic considerations (since the ordinary people like to lay their hands on
the animal immediately before its sacrifice, prohibition of the laying of hands
during festivals will deter them from offering sacrifices) but also because
Beit Hillel does not accept the notion that the laying on of hands effects a
complete transfer of identity. The gap which has a place in the relationship
modeled by the Song of Songs and personified in the braita's depiction of R.
Akiva is also championed by Beit Hillel. The gap, with all its shortcomings (it
lacks<i> hidabkut</i>) and advantages (it allows for entry and exit from the
orchard and leaves room for disagreement) is the central theme that informs the
composition of the second chapter of Tosefta Hagigah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

states that when a court performs a conversion it acts &quot;within the
framework of and as part of the commandment to love God&quot; and the
commandment to convert becomes a positive commandment incumbent upon the court

of his heart to cleave [<i>lehidabek</i>] to God and to His commandments,&quot;
that being the essence of conversion. Thus, for example, there is no
commandment to convert a deaf and dumb woman (since even deaf and dumb Jews are
not obligated with the commandments) and the result of such a conversion would
be merely social and would not draw her in &quot;under the wings of the Divine
Presence.&quot; The Hareidi Rabbinate's one dimensional understanding of
conversion as a religious act of cleaving to God without any gaps (which is
expressed chiefly, of course, through the performance of commandments) stands
in contradiction to the traditional Jewish approach to cleaving - the tradition

for mercy upon Israel, but he did not do so. The Holy One, Blessed Be He, said to
him: &quot;You pleaded for your own needs, go and return to Damascus&quot;. And
so is written with regards to Hezkiah: <i>For there will be peace and truth in
my days </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Isaiah 39:8)</span>. The Holy One,
Blessed Be He, said to him: &quot;You have pleaded for your own needs.&quot; <i>Comfort,
oh comfort My people, says your God </i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>(Ibid
40:1)</span>,<span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> </span>and
you [Israel] have no need for Elijah’s prayer.&quot;</p>

the tribulations and the suffering and the exile are proportionate to the lack
of <i>da'at </i>[knowledge, understanding]. When <i>da'at</i> will be complete,

do you lack?&quot; and as is written: <i>Assuredly, My people will suffer exile
for lacking da'at,</i> and the essential element of eternal life - to be in the
world to come - will be a result of <i>da'at. </i>For <i>da'at</i> will spread,
and all will know God, and through <i>da'at</i> all will be part of His unity,
and then all will live eternal life as He does, for through <i>da'at</i> all
are part of Him, as was said by the Sage, &quot;If I knew Him, I would be Him.&quot;
The principle part of <i>da'at</i> will be in the future, as is written, <i>For
the earth will be filled with de'ah, </i>and because of <i>da'at, </i>nothing
good will be lacking - all will be good.</p>
